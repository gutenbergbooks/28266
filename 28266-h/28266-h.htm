Voilà un mélodrame que j&#8217;ai fait, le dernier de
plusieurs mélodrames anglais qui ont Lagardère
pour héros. Des mots remplacent l&#8217;action, des mots
remplacent le décor, les costumes, et les accessoires;
mais enfin ce pastiche n&#8217;est qu&#8217;une pièce et non un
roman. Je l&#8217;ai fait pour Lewis Waller, acteur
romantique s&#8217;il en fut, et grandement doué des
qualités qui appartiennent par tradition à Lagardère.
J&#8217;ai su, il y a longtemps, grâce à M. Jules Claretie, que
vous étiez le vrai createur de ce paladin, Lagardère,
pair de d&#8217;Artagnan, pair de Cyrano, pair presque de
Roland et d&#8217;Olivier. Et si je ne l&#8217;avais pas su,
j&#8217;aurais pu l&#8217;apprendre dernièrement en lisant ce
livre aussi plein de charme que d&#8217;érudition, "Les
Anciens Théâtres de Paris" de M. Georges Cain.
Mais je crois que cette vérité est connue de peu de
monde dans les pays où se parle la langue anglaise,
que quand on loue "Le Bossu" de Féval on doit
aussi louer "Le Bossu" de Sardou.

<h3>THE SEVEN DEVILS</h3>
</div>

<p>
It was very warm in the inn room, but it was so
much warmer outside, in the waning flames of the
late September evening, that the dark room seemed
veritably cool to those who escaped into its shelter
from the fading sunlight outside. A window was open
to let in what little air was stirring, and from that
window a spectator with a good head might look
down a sheer drop of more than thirty feet into the
moat of the Castle of Caylus. The Inn of the Seven
Devils was perched on the lip of one rock, and Caylus
Castle on the lip of another. Between the two lay
the gorge, which had been partially utilized to form
the moat of the castle, and which continued its way
towards the Spanish mountains. Beyond the castle
a bridge spanned the ravine, carrying on the road
towards the frontier. The moat itself was dry now,
for war and Caylus had long been disassociated, and
France was, for the moment, at peace with her neighbor,
if at peace with few other powers. A young
thirteenth Louis, a son of the great fourth Henri, now
sat upon the throne of France, and seemingly believed
himself to be the ruler of his kingdom, though a newly
made Cardinal de Richelieu held a different opinion,
and acted according to his conviction with great pertinacity
and skill.
</p>
<p>
Inside the Inn of the Seven Devils, on this heavy
day of early autumn, seven men were sitting. It
was an odd chance, and the men had joked about it
heavily&mdash;there was one man for each devil of the Inn&#8217;s
name. Six of these men were grouped about a table
furnished with flagons and beakers, and were doing
their best to alleviate the external heat by copious
draughts of the rough but not unkindly native wine
which Martine, the plain-faced maid of the Inn, dispensed
generously enough from a ruddy earthenware
pitcher. A stranger entering the room would, at the
first glance, have taken the six men seated around the
table for soldiers, for all were stalwart fellows, with
broad bodies and long limbs, bronzed faces and swaggering
carriage, and behind them where they sat six
great rapiers dangled from nails in the wall, rapiers
which the revellers had removed from their sides for
their greater ease and comfort. But if the suppositious
stranger were led to study the men a little more
closely, he would be tempted to correct his first impression.
The swaggering carriage of the men lacked
something of the stiffness inevitably to be associated
with military training in the days when the levies
of the Sun-King were held, or at least held themselves
to be, the finest troops in Europe, a cheerful opinion
which no amount of military misfortune could dissipate.
</p>
<p>
Each of the drinkers of the inn had his own individuality
of swagger, his truculent independence of
mien, which suggested a man by no means habitually
used either to receive commands or to render
unquestioning obedience. Each of the men resembled
his fellows in a certain flamboyant air of ferocity,
but no one of them resembled the others by wearing
that air of harmonious training with other men which
links together a company of seasoned soldiers. With
their long cloaks and their large hats and their high
boots, with their somewhat shabby garments stained
with age and sweat and wine, in many places patched
and in many places tattered, with their tangled locks
and ragged mustachios, the revellers had on closer
study more the appearance of brigands, or at least
of guerillas, than of regular troops. As a matter of
fact, they were neither soldiers nor brigands, though
their way of life endowed them with some of the
virtues of the soldier and most of the vices of the
brigand.
</p>
<p>
There was not a man in that room who lacked
courage of the fiercest kind; there was but one man
in the room with intelligence enough to appreciate
the possibility of an existence uncoupled with the
possession of courage of the fiercest kind. There
was not a man in the room who had the slightest fear
of death, save in so far as death meant the cessation
of those privileges of eating grossly, drinking grossly,
and loving grossly, which every man of the jack-rascals
prized not a little. There was not a man in
the room that was not prepared to serve the person,
whoever he might be, who had bought his sword to
strike and his body to be stricken, so long as the
buyer and the bought had agreed upon the price, and
so long as the man who carried the sword felt confident
that the man who dandled the purse meant
to meet his bargain.
</p>
<p>
These were the soldierly virtues. But, further,
there was not a man in the room who would have
felt the smallest compunction in cutting any man&#8217;s
throat if he had full pockets, or shaming any woman&#8217;s
honor if she had good looks. These were their
brigand&#8217;s vices. Fearless in their conduct, filthy
in their lives, the assembled rogues were as ugly a
bunch of brutalities as ever sprawled in a brothel,
brawled in a tavern, or crawled from some dark corner
to cut down their unsuspicious prey.
</p>
<p>
The six fellows that sat around the wine-stained,
knife-notched table of the Inn of the Seven Devils had
little in them to interest a serious student of humanity,
if such a one had chanced, for his misfortune, to find
his way to that wicked wine-house on that wicked
evening. There were differences of nationality among
the half-dozen; that was plain enough from their features
and from their speech, for though they all talked,
or thought they talked, in French, each man did
his speaking with an accent that betrayed his nativity.
As the babbling voices rose and fell in alternations of
argument that was almost quarrel, narrative that was
sometimes diverting, and ribaldry that was never wit,
it would seem as if the ruffianism of half Europe had
called a conference in that squalid, horrible little inn.
Guttural German notes mixed whimsically with sibilant
Spanish and flowing Portuguese. Cracked
Biscayan&mdash;which no Spaniard will allow to be Spanish&mdash;jarred
upon the suavity of Italian accents, and
through the din the heavy steadiness of a Breton
voice could be heard asserting itself. Though every
man spoke in French, for the purposes of the common
parliament, each man swore in his own tongue;
and they all swore briskly and crisply, with a seemingly
inexhaustible vocabulary of blasphemy and obscenity,
so that the foul air of that inn parlor was
rendered fouler still by the volley of oaths&mdash;German,
Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Biscayan, and Breton&mdash;that
were fired into its steaming, stinking atmosphere.
So much for the six men that sat at the table.
</p>
<p>
The seventh man in the room, although he was of
the same fellowship, was curiously unlike his fellows.
While the others were burly, well-set-up fellows, who
held their heads high enough and thrust out their
chests valiantly and sprawled their strong limbs at
ease, the seventh man was a hunchback, short of
stature and slender of figure, with a countenance
whose quiet malignity contrasted decisively with the
patent brutality of his comrades. The difference between
the one and the others was accentuated even
in dress, for, while the swashbucklers at the table loved
to bedizen themselves with an amount of ferocious
finery, and showed in their sordid garments a quantity
of color that likened them to a bunch of faded
wild flowers, the hunchback was clad soberly in black
that was well-worn, indeed, and grizzled at the seams,
but neatly attended. He sat in the window, reading
intently in a little volume, and, again unlike his
associates, while he read he nursed between his knees
a long and formidable rapier. Those at the table
paid him no heed; most of them knew his ways, and
he, on his side, seemed to be quite undisturbed in his
studies by the noise and clamor of the drinking-party,
and to be entirely absorbed in the delights of literature.
</p>
<p>
But if the hunchback student was quite content
to let his companions be, and to find his pleasures in
scholarship of a kind, it came about that one of his
companions, in a misguided moment, found himself
less content to leave the hunchback student undisturbed.
It was the one of the company that knew
least about him&mdash;Pinto the Biscayan, newest recruit
in that huddle of ruffians, and therefore the less inclined
than his fellows to let a sleeping dog lie. He
had been drinking deeply, for your Biscayans are
potent topers, and in the course of his cups he discovered
that it irritated him to see that quiet, silent figure
perched there in the window with its wry body as
still as if it had been snipped out of cardboard, with
its comical long nose poked over a book, with its colorless
puckered lips moving, as if the reader muttered
to himself the meaning of what he read, and tasted
an unclean pleasure in so doing. So Pinto pulled himself
to his feet, steadied himself with the aid of the
table edge, and then, with a noiseless dexterity that
showed the practised assassin, whose talent it is to
pad in shadows, he crossed the room and came up behind
the hunchback before the hunchback was, or
seemed to be, aware of his neighborhood.
</p>
<p>
"What are you reading?" he hiccoughed. "Let
us have a peep at it." And before the hunchback
could make an answer Pinto had picked the book
quickly from the hunchback&#8217;s fingers and held it to
his own face to see what it told about.
</p>
<p>
Now it would have profited Biscayan Pinto very
little if he had been given time to study the volume,
at least so far as its text was concerned, for the little
book was a manuscript copy of the <i>Luxurious Sonnets</i>
of that Pietro Aretino whom men, or rather some
men, once called "The Divine." The book was illustrated
as well, not unskilfully, with sketches that
professed to be illuminative of the text in the manner
of Giulio Romano. These might have pleased
the Biscayan, for if he had no Italian, and could,
therefore, make nothing of the voluptuousness of the
Scourge of Princes, he could, at least, see as well as
another savage the meaning of a lewd image. But
the privilege was denied him. Scarcely had he got
the book in his fingers when it was plucked from them
again, and thereafter, while with his left hand the
hunchback slipped the booklet into the breast of his
doublet, with his right hand he dealt Pinto such a
buffet on the side of his head as sent him reeling
across the floor, to bring up with a dull thud at the
table against the backs of his nearest companions.
</p>
<p>
Instantly all was tumult. Pinto, black with anger,
screamed Biscayan maledictions and struggled to get
at his sword where it hung against the wall, while his
comrades, clinging to him and impeding him, were
trying in every variety of bad French to dissuade him
from a purpose which they were well enough aware
must needs end disastrously for him. For they all
knew, what the raw Biscayan did not know, how
strong was the arm and how terrible the sword of the
hunchback whose studies Pinto had so rudely and so
foolishly interrupted. As for the hunchback himself,
he stood quietly by his chair, with his hands resting
on the pommel of his rapier, and a disagreeable smile
twisting new hints of malignity into features that were
malign enough in repose. Now it may be that the
sight of that frightful smile had its effect in cooling
the hot blood of the Biscayan, for, indeed, the hunchback,
as he stood there, so quietly alert, so demoniacally
watchful, seemed the most terrible antagonist
he had ever challenged. At least, in a little while the
Biscayan, drinking in swiftly the warnings of his companions,
consented to be pacified, consented even to
be apologetic on a whispered hint, that was also a
whispered threat, from his leader, that there should
be no brawling among friends.
</p>
<p>
"It was only a joke, comrade," he said, sullenly,
and flung himself heavily into his empty seat. The
hunchback nodded grimly.
</p>
<p>
"I like a joke as well as any man," he said, "and
can make one myself if occasion serve."
</p>
<p>
Therewith he seated himself anew, and, pulling the
book from his bosom, resumed his reading and his
silent mouthing, while something of a gloom brooded
over his fellows at the table. It was to dissipate this
gloom that presently the man who sat at the head
of the table, a bald and red-faced fellow who looked
a German, and who seemed to exercise some kind of
headship over the others, pushed back his chair a
little from the board and glanced half anxiously and
half angrily towards the inn door. Then he thumped
his red fist upon the wood till the flagons clattered and
rattled.
</p>
<p>
"Why don&#8217;t the late dogs come to heel?" he grumbled,
speaking with a strong Teutonic accent. "It is
long past the hour, and I like punctuality."
</p>
<p>
A Spaniard at his right hand, swarthy, not ill-looking,
whom his friends called Pepe el Matador,
grinned into the German&#8217;s face.
</p>
<p>
"Will not this string of swords serve the turn?"
he said, and pointed with a dirty, well-shaped hand
to the six long rapiers that hung against the wall behind
them.
</p>
<p>
The Italian, Faenza, began to laugh a little, quiet,
teasing laugh; the sullen Biscayan, Pinto, patted el
Matador on the back; Joel de Jurgan the Breton,
stared stolidly; and Saldagno the Portuguese, refreshed
himself with a drink. Encouraged by what
he conceived to be the sympathy of his comrades,
Pepe renewed the attack. "Come, Staupitz, come,"
he questioned, "are not those swords long enough
and sharp enough to scare the devil?"
</p>
<p>
Staupitz struck the table again. "No, no, my children,"
he said, "not for this job. Monsieur Peyrolles
told me to bring nine of my babies, and nine we must
be, and nine we should be at this moment if our
truants were at hand."
</p>
<p>
At this moment Saldagno set down his beaker. "I
hear footsteps," he said. In the momentary silence
which followed this remark, all present could hear
distinctly enough the tramp of feet outside, and in
another instant the door was flung open and the two
men whom Staupitz had been expecting so impatiently
made their appearance.
</p>
<p>
If the contrast had been marked between the six
men who sat at the table and the seventh man who
sat apart, the contrast that existed between the two
new-comers was still more striking. The first to enter
was a big, jovial, red-faced, black-haired man
with a huge mustache and a manner that suggested
an ebullient admiration of himself and an ebullient
appreciation of all possible pleasures. He was habited
much like his predecessors, in that he was booted,
cloaked, hatted, and sworded as they were booted,
cloaked, hatted, and sworded, but everything with
him, owing, it may be, to his flagrant Gascon nationality,
tended to an extravagance of exaggeration that
made him seem almost like a caricature of the others.
His hat was bigger, his cloak more voluminous, his
boots more assertive, his sword longer, his taste for
colors at once more pronounced and more gaudy. If
the others might be likened in their coloring to faded
wild flowers, this man seemed to blaze like some
monstrous exotic. He was a swashbuckler whom
Callot would have loved to paint.
</p>
<p>
While he entered the room with his air of splendid
assurance that suggested that the Inn belonged to him,
and greeted those that awaited him with such a nod
as a monarch might accord to his vassals, he was followed
by one that showed in almost every particular
his opposite. This one, that represented an extreme
of Norman character as his ally represented an extreme
of Gascon character, this one that seemed to
shelter timidly behind the effulgence of his companion,
was a lean, lanky, pallid fellow, clad wholly in
black of a rustier and shabbier kind than that worn
by the reader in the window. From beneath his
dingy black felt hat thin wisps of flaxen hair flowed
ridiculously enough about his scraggy neck. While
his Gascon comrade entered the room with the manner
of one who carries all before him, the Norman
seemed to creep, or rather to slink, in with lack-lustre
eyes peering apologetically about him through lowered
pink eyelids, while his twitching fingers appeared to
protest apologetically for his intrusion into a society
so far above his deserts. But if in almost every particular
he was the opposite to his friend, in one
particular, however, he resembled him, for a long rapier
hung from his side and slapped against his lean
calves.
</p>
<p>
In a further regard, moreover, the two new-comers,
however different they might seem in build of body
and in habit of apparel, resembled each other more
closely than they resembled any of the earlier occupants
of the Inn room. There are castes in rascality
as in all other trades, classes, professions, and mysteries,
honorable or dishonorable, and this latest pair
of knaves belonged patently to the more amiable caste
of ruffianism&mdash;a higher or a lower caste, as you may
be pleased to look at it. In the bold eyes of the
gaudily clad Gascon, as in the uneasy eyes of the
sable-coated Norman, there was a quality of candor
which might be sought for in vain among the rogues
that greeted them. Certainly neither the Gascon nor
the Norman would have seemed reassuring figures to
a timid traveller on a lonely road, and yet there was,
as it were, a kind of gentility in their composition
which would have been obvious to a reader of men,
and would have approved them as, in their way and
of their race, trustworthy. Here, the reader of men
would say, are a brace of assassins who hold a sort of
honor in their hearts, who would never skulk in a corner
to stab an enemy in the back, nor wrong a wretched
woman who plainly was unwilling to be wronged&mdash;a
brace of heroes. And the reader of men would
for once in a way, have been in the right.

<h3>THE THRUST OF NEVERS</h3>
</div>

<p>
At the sight of the two men, the ruffians at the
table set up a roar of welcome and bumped their
mugs lustily upon the board to a chorus of greeting,
in which the names of Cocardasse and Passepoil were
repeated in a variety of accents from German to
Italian, from Portuguese to Biscayan, from Spanish
to Breton, but in all cases with the same degree of
enthusiasm and admiration. The big, gaudy fellow,
patently pleased by the tribute, struck a magnificent
attitude and extended a benedictory hand towards
the drinkers. "Courage, chanticleers!" he shouted&mdash;"comrades
all," and, advancing towards the table, gave
Staupitz a lusty slap on the back, while Passepoil, following
nervously behind him, whispered beneath his
breath and behind his lifted hand a timid "Greeting,
gentlemen," which was hardly audible in the buzz
of voices. But while Cocardasse was busy engaging
clasps of the hand with the men of many nationalities
who had been waiting for him, the attention of Passepoil
was entirely diverted by the appearance of
the Inn maid, Martine, who at that moment appeared
upon the scene with a fresh pitcher of wine in honor
of the fresh arrivals. The lean and pale man blushed
and sighed as he saw her. Those in the room that
knew the Norman were well aware that love of woman
was his weakness, and they paid no heed to his attempted
philandering, taking it, so far as they thought
of it at all, as a matter of course and honest Passepoil&#8217;s
way.
</p>
<p>
Though Martine was as little comely as need be,
she was still a woman, and a woman Passepoil had
never seen before, and, sidling towards her, he endeavored
to enter into amicable conversation, which
was received but indifferently well. By this time Cocardasse
had finished his greetings, and, drawing back
a step or two, surveyed the company with a look of
satisfaction not unmingled with astonishment.
</p>
<p>
"Why, Papa Staupitz," he said, "here we have
many friends and all fine blades. This is indeed a
pleasure party." His eyes travelled from the table
to the window, where the man in black still sat and
read quite unconcernedly. Something like surprise
puckered Cocardasse&#8217;s rubicund face. "You here,
Æsop?" he questioned.
</p>
<p>
The man whom he called Æsop looked up for a
moment from his book and shrugged his shoulders.
"Devil knows why!" he said. "If they want me,
they don&#8217;t want the others. If they want the others,
they don&#8217;t want me."
</p>
<p>
His remarks were interrupted by a slight scuffle
between Passepoil and Martine. Passepoil had so far
conquered his natural timidity as to go to the length
of soliciting a kiss from the Inn maid. She had successfully
repulsed him with a slap on each of his
cheeks, and had slipped from the room. While Passepoil
was rubbing his face ruefully, Æsop went on,
sardonically:
</p>
<p>
"What do you think of it, friend Cocardasse? Here
we are, nine of us, nine picked swordsmen, and we are
going to fight one man."
</p>
<p>
Cocardasse had returned to the table and filled himself
a monstrous measure of wine. He was thirsty, an
habitual state with him, and he eyed the rough wine
lovingly.
</p>
<p>
"Who is the giant who is going to fight nine
of us?" he asked as he lifted his cup from the
board.
</p>
<p>
Passepoil, who, enjoying like his comrade an abiding
drought, had followed his example, hoping to find consolation
in wine for the disappointments of love, also
expressed his surprise.
</p>
<p>
"Every man of us can fight three men at a time,"
he whispered, timidly, and he, too, lifted his glass.
</p>
<p>
"Who is the man, anyhow?" said Cocardasse,
cheerfully, making the wine swing in the vessel; and
Staupitz answered him, slowly:
</p>
<p>
"Louis, Duke of Nevers."
</p>
<p>
The effect of this simple speech upon the new-comers
was exceedingly remarkable. Cocardasse
seemed suddenly to forget his thirst, for he set down
his untasted mug upon the table. Passepoil did the
like. "Oh!" said Cocardasse, solemnly. "Ah!" said
Passepoil, gloomily.
</p>
<p>
For a few appreciable seconds of strained excitement
to those that watched them the pair remained
rigid, staring at their rejected wine-cups, as if the
liquor they contained had some monstrous Medusa-like
property of stiffening into stone all those that
presumed to drink of it. Then the Gascon, slowly
turning his head, gazed steadfastly at the Norman;
and the Norman, slowly turning his head, gazed
steadfastly at the Gascon, and then the pair, so gazing,
both wagged their polls very solemnly indeed, and
puckered their eyebrows and betrayed many other
very visible signs of dissatisfaction, not to say of discomfort.
Then Cocardasse muttered to his comrade
the words "Louis de Nevers," as if they were not at
all to his liking, and Passepoil, in his turn, repeated the
words, as if they were not at all to his liking, and
then they both sighed and grunted and were silent.
</p>
<p>
The look of stupefaction, not to say consternation,
on the faces of the new arrivals was patent to every
man in the room&mdash;most patent and most unpalatable
to the leader of the gang. Staupitz thrust his red,
Teutonic face forward with a mocking look and a
mocking voice as he grunted: "Seems to me you
don&#8217;t relish the job."
</p>
<p>
Cocardasse nodded at him with perfect affability,
and patted his shoulder with a massive, red hand.
"Papa Staupitz," he said, good-humoredly, "you
read me like a book."
</p>
<p>
"In the largest print," added Passepoil, who generally
supplemented any remark of his comrade with
some approving comment of his own.
</p>
<p>
Staupitz swung round in his chair, upsetting a tankard
in his angry movement, as he glared, all rage, at
the strangely assorted pair. "Are you afraid?" he
asked, with guttural contempt.
</p>
<p>
Cocardasse grinned and showed his large, dog-like
teeth. "I am not afraid of you, Papa Staupitz," he
said, quite cheerfully, "nor of any man in this room,
nor of all the men in this room."
</p>
<p>
Passepoil added, stammering in his speech, blinking
his pink eyelids rapidly: "If any gentleman
doubts the point, there is a pleasant bit of kitchen
garden outside where we can adjourn and argue the
matter pleasantly together, as gentlemen should."
</p>
<p>
Nobody present seemed inclined to pick a quarrel
either with the ebullient Gascon or the hesitating Norman.
The six bullies at the table knew well enough,
and savage, masterful Æsop at the window knew well
enough, that the swaggering Gascon was the first
fencing-master in Paris, and that his colleague, the
Norman, for all his air of ineffable timidity, was only
second to him in skill with the weapon and readiness
to use it. There was a moment&#8217;s silence, and then
Cocardasse observed: "I&#8217;m afraid of just two men in
the world."
</p>
<p>
"The same with me," added Passepoil, humbly.
</p>
<p>
Cocardasse resumed his interrupted speech: "And
one of them is Louis de Nevers."
</p>
<p>
Staupitz&#8217;s puzzled, angry face travelled round the
room, ranging over the Gascon, the Norman, the
Spaniard, the Portuguese, the Biscayan, the Breton,
and the hunchback. "Thunder and weather!" he
cried; "is not nine to one good enough odds for
you?"
</p>
<p>
The others, with the exception of Æsop, who still
seemed to read as peacefully in his book as if he were
alone in the room, appeared inclined to applaud the
question of their chief, but Cocardasse was not in the
least impressed by the retort. He replied to Staupitz&#8217;s
query with another&mdash;"Have you never heard of
the secret thrust of Nevers?"
</p>
<p>
A new silence seemed to fall upon the company,
and for the second time since the Gascon and the Norman
had entered the room the hunchback took a
part in the conversation, closing his book as he did
so, but carefully keeping a finger between the pages to
mark the place. "I don&#8217;t believe in secret thrusts,"
he said, decisively.
</p>
<p>
The Gascon moved a little away from Staupitz and
a little nearer to Æsop, whom he looked at fixedly.
The hunchback sustained his gaze with his habitual
air of cold indifference. Cocardasse spoke: "You
will, if you ever face Louis de Nevers. Now, Passepoil,
here, and I, we are, I believe, held in general repute
as pretty good swordsmen&mdash;"
</p>
<p>
Passepoil interrupted, stuttering furiously in his
excitement: "But he touched us with that secret
thrust in our own school in Paris&mdash;"
</p>
<p>
Cocardasse completed his friend&#8217;s statement: "Three
times, here on the forehead, just between the eyes."
</p>
<p>
Passepoil labored his point: "Devil take us if we
could find a parry for it."
</p>
<p>
Cocardasse summed up his argument, gloomily:
"They say it has never been parried, never will be
parried."
</p>
<p>
Again an awkward silence reigned. With a shrug
of his shoulders, Æsop resumed his studies, finding
Aretino more diverting than such nonsense. Breton
stared at Teuton; Italian interrogated Spaniard;
Portuguese questioned Biscayan. The affairs of the
party seemed to be at a dead-lock. The fact was that
Staupitz and his little band of babies, as he was
pleased to call them, were not really of the same
social standing in the world of cutthroats as Gascon
Cocardasse and Norman Passepoil. Cocardasse and
his companion were recognized fencing-masters in
Paris, well esteemed, if not of the highest note,
whereas Staupitz was no better than an ordinary
bully-broker, and his so-styled children no more than
provincial rascallions. It was not for them, and they
knew it, to display such knowledge of the great world
as might be aired by Cocardasse and Passepoil, and
when Cocardasse spoke with so much significance
about the thrust of Nevers, and questioned them with
so much insistence about the thrust of Nevers, it was
plain that he spoke from the brimmings of a wisdom
richer than their own. Staupitz, who was in some
sense a son of Paris, if only an adopted son, and that,
indeed, by process of self-adoption, knew enough of
Olympian matters to be aware that there was an
illustrious gentleman that was Duke of Nevers, whom
he was equally willing to aid with his sword or slay
with his sword, if occasion served. Now occasion
seemed to demand that Staupitz should follow the
latter course. He was employed to kill somebody,
and Æsop had assured him that this somebody was
Louis, Duke de Nevers. Staupitz had not cared
who it was; it was all one to him, but honestly he
was troubled now by the patent trouble of Cocardasse
and his ominous mutterings about the thrust of Nevers.
</p>
<p>
Passepoil broke the silence, surveying the puzzled
faces around him. "No wonder there&#8217;s such a crowd
of us." And for the first time there was something
like the sound of audacity in his voice and a glance
of audacity on his visage.
</p>
<p>
"Faith," said Cocardasse, emphatically, "I&#8217;d rather
face an army than face Louis de Nevers."
</p>
<p>
Again there was a silence. The gentlemen of the
sword seemed to be at a loss for conversation. Again
Passepoil broke the silence, this time with a question:
"Why are we after Louis de Nevers?"
</p>
<p>
Nobody seemed to be able to answer him. Even
Staupitz, who was responsible to the others for this
gathering of the company, was baffled. He had been
told to supply nine swords, and he had supplied them.
He had been told by his employer the purpose for
which the nine swords were wanted&mdash;he had been
told by Æsop against whom those nine swords were to
be drawn&mdash;and that was the extent of his knowledge.
This time the hunchback, in his favorite character of
know-all, took the lead. He put his book in his
pocket, as if he perceived that further study was to
be denied him that afternoon, with so much noise and
bustle of curiosity about him, and rose from his chair.
Holding his long rapier behind his back with both
his hands, he advanced into the middle of the room,
where he proceeded to harangue his fellow-guardsmen.
</p>
<p>
"I can tell you," he said, harshly, "if you would
care to hear the story."
</p>
<p>
Now bravos, swashbucklers, spadassins, and such
soldiers of fortune are like children in this regard&mdash;as
indeed in many another&mdash;that they love a good
yarn well spun. If something in the dominating,
masterful manner of Æsop compelled their attention,
something also in the malicious smile that twitched
his lips seemed to promise plenitude of entertainment.
A grave quiet settled upon the ragamuffins,
their sunburned faces were turned eagerly towards
the hunchback, their wild eyes studied his mocking
face; they waited in patience upon his pleasure.
Pleased with the humility of his audience, Æsop began
his narrative.
</p>
<p>
"There are," he said, "now living three noble gentlemen
in the first flush of youth, in the first flight
of greatness, young, handsome, brilliant, more like
brothers than friends. They are known in the noble
world of the court as the three Louis, because by a
curious chance each of these splendid gentlemen carries
Louis for a Christian name. Humorists have been
known to speak of them as the three Louis d&#8217;or. The
first is none other than our good king&#8217;s person, Louis
of Bourbon, thirteenth monarch of his name; the
second is Louis, Duke of Nevers; the third is his
cousin, Louis of Mantua, Prince of Gonzague."
</p>
<p>
He paused for a moment, looking with the satisfaction
of a tale-teller at the expectant faces before
him, and as he paused an approving murmur from
his audience urged him to continue. Æsop resumed
his narration.
</p>
<p>
"You will ask how the Italianate Mantuan comes
to be a cousin of our French Nevers, and I will tell
you. Nevers&#8217;s father, Louis de Nevers, the twelfth
duke, had a very beautiful sister, who was foolish
enough, or wise enough, as you may choose to take
it, to fall in love with a needy Italian nobleman that
came adventuring to Paris in the hope of making a
rich marriage. He made a rich marriage, or perhaps it
would be more accurate to say that he thought he made
a rich marriage. He married Mademoiselle de Nevers."
</p>
<p>
Again Æsop halted, employing one of the familiar
devices of rhetoricians, who lure their hearers to keener
interest by such judicious pauses in the course of
their exposition. The listening ruffians were as attentive
as babes at a day-school, and Æsop, with a
hideous distortion of his features, which he intended
for a pleased smile, went on with his story:
</p>
<p>
"Mademoiselle de Nevers had some fortune of her
own, of course, but it was not large; it was not the
feast for which the amative Mantuan had hungered.
The Nevers&#8217;s fortune was in the duke&#8217;s hands, and remained
in the duke&#8217;s hands, for the duke married at
much the same time as his sister; and the duke&#8217;s wife
and Gonzague&#8217;s wife were brought to bed much about
the same time, and each bore a son, and each son was
named Louis after the twelfth duke, out of the affection
his wife bore him, out of the affection his sister
bore him, and out of the affection that sister&#8217;s Mantuan
husband pretended, in his sly Italian manner,
to bear him."
</p>
<p>
A belated patriotism stirring vaguely in Faenza&#8217;s
muddled mind tempted him to resent the hunch-back&#8217;s
slights upon the land which had been unlucky
enough to mother him.
</p>
<p>
"All men of Italy are not knaves," he growled,
huskily, and, half rising from his seat with crimsoned
visage, he was busying himself to say more, when
Staupitz, who was as interested as the others in Master
Æsop&#8217;s scandalous chronicle, clapped one bear&#8217;s
paw on Faenza&#8217;s shoulder and another bear&#8217;s paw
across Faenza&#8217;s mouth, and thus forced him at once,
by sheer effort of brute strength, to a sitting posture
and to silence. This action on the part of the man
whom for the time being he had consented to accept
as his general, combined with the cold glance of
cruelty and scorn which Æsop gave him, served to
cool Faenza&#8217;s hot blood. He heard Æsop say, dryly,
"Some men of Italy are fools," and might perchance
have flamed again, to his misluck, but that Staupitz,
breathing thickly in his ear, whispered: "Idiot, he
mocks a Mantuan. Are not you Naples born and
bred?" Faenza, recovering his composure, resolved
himself swiftly from an Italian in general to a Neapolitan
in particular, with a clannish antagonism to
alien states. He spat upon the floor. "Damn all
Mantuans!" he muttered, and did no more to interrupt
the flow of Æsop&#8217;s discourse.
</p>
<p>
"As I was saying, this princeling of Gonzague affected
a great show of friendship for his ducal brother
of Nevers, and this same friendship he left&mdash;it was,
indeed, wellnigh all he had to leave&mdash;to his only son
and only child, the present prince of Gonzague."
</p>
<p>
He made a momentary halt, as if he were observing
curiously the effect of his words upon his hearers,
then resumed:
</p>
<p>
"The young Louis de Gonzague and the young Louis
de Nevers were almost of an age. Each was an only
child, each was an only son, each was clever, each
was courageous, each was comely, each was the
chosen heart&#8217;s friend of a namesake king, each was
much a lover of ladies, each was much loved by
ladies."
</p>
<p>
Æsop grinned hideously as he said these words,
and his left hand fumbled lovingly at the little volume
that lay hid in the breast of his doublet, but he
did not delay the flow of his words.
</p>
<p>
"The chief difference between the two young men
who were bound so closely by ties of blood and yet
more closely by ties of personal affection was that
while Louis de Nevers was the heir to all the treasures
of his house, Louis of Gonzague was heir to little more
than a rotting palace and a hollow title. And yet, by
the irony of nature that seemed to deny long life to
any of the stock of Nevers, Louis de Gonzague was
the next of kin to his cousin, and the heir to all
his wealth if by any ill chance the dear young duke
should die unmarried."
</p>
<p>
Here Æsop deliberately shut his mouth for several
seconds, while the listening bandits, persuaded that
some thrilling news was toward, nudged each other
with their elbows and riddled the watchful hunchback
with imploring glances that entreated him to
proceed. Thus mutely importuned, Æsop opened his
mouth again:
</p>
<p>
"But the difference in the youths&#8217; fortunes never
made any difference in their friendship. The purse
of the rich Nevers was always open to the fingers of
the poor Gonzague, and the poor Gonzague had always
too true an appreciation of the meaning of
friendship to deny his heart&#8217;s brother the privilege
of ministering to his needs. And as the young Nevers
did not hint at the slightest inclination to marry
and settle down, but always declared himself and approved
himself the most vagrant of lovers and the
most frivolous of libertines, there seemed no reason
for the good Gonzague to be uneasy as to his possible
heritage. Moreover, the young Duke of Nevers
was something delicate of constitution, as it would
seem, for all his skill as a soldier and swordsman and
his fame as a lady&#8217;s man. Once when he was the
guest of his cousin of Gonzague in Mantua he fell ill
of a strange fever that came near to ending his days,
and was only saved by his French physician, who
tended him day and night and took him back to
France in the first dawn of his convalescence."
</p>
<p>
Æsop stopped and blinked at his hearers viciously,
looking like some school-master that wonders how
much or how little of what he has been saying his
pupils have understood. Cocardasse was the first
to show intelligence and to give it tongue.
</p>
<p>
"I&#8217;ll wager," he cried, and swore a great Gascon
oath, "that I can hazard a pretty guess as to the
name of our employer in to-night&#8217;s work."
</p>
<p>
Æsop leered at him with a pitying benignity.
</p>
<p>
"You were always a great brain for deduction,
friend Cocardasse," he said. "And who should you
say was the honest gentleman who wanted our swords
for this present business?"
</p>
<p>
"Why," answered Cocardasse, shaking his head
gloomily, "though I hate to think it, and hate to
say it, it seems to me that the man who has most
to gain from this little meeting and its inevitable result
is none other than the third Louis, your Italian
of Gonzague."
</p>
<p>
Æsop nodded, and a ferocious smile illuminated
his evil face.
</p>
<p>
"You have come to a very creditable conclusion,
friend Cocardasse. It looks very much as if Jonathan
wanted to kill David, as if Patroclus yearned to
slaughter Achilles, as if Pythias wanted to extinguish
Damon."
</p>
<p>
Master Æsop prided himself upon his scholarship
and his felicity in classical allusion&mdash;a felicity wholly
wasted upon his present audience.
</p>
<p>
Cocardasse was still curious. "Why does Louis de
Gonzague want to kill his friend, Louis of Nevers,
just at this particular moment, and why here in this
heaven-forgotten hole of a place, in this heaven-forgotten
corner of the world?"
</p>
<p>
Æsop explained: "Because Louis de Gonzague,
having tried once, with good reason, and failed, tries
again with better reason and means to succeed this
time, believing much steel to do better than a little
poison. Because, in a few words, Louis de Gonzague
wants to marry the beautiful Gabrielle, daughter of
old Caylus of the castle there, who is wealthy, too."
</p>
<p>
Passepoil, who was always interested in affairs of
the heart, put in his word. "Why doesn&#8217;t he marry
her?"
</p>
<p>
Æsop was ready to explain that matter also: "Because
Gabrielle de Caylus is already secretly married
to Louis de Nevers. They were married one year ago
in the chapel of Caylus, and the only witnesses were
Louis de Gonzague and his factotum, Monsieur Peyrolles,
who has summoned us to this tryst."
</p>
<p>
"Why were they secretly married?" asked the amorous
Passepoil.
</p>
<p>
Æsop answered him: "An old family feud between
the houses of Nevers and Caylus. The marquis
would rather kill his daughter than let her marry
Louis de Nevers. So they were wedded secretly,
without his knowledge, and Louis de Gonzague, that
could deny his dear friend and cousin, Louis de Nevers,
nothing, helped him to his wife."
</p>
<p>
"That was generous, at least," Passepoil sighed.
</p>
<p>
Æsop sneered. "He hoped, as he believed with reason,
that there would be no issue of the marriage, and
that by-and-by he would come to what he called his
own. But three months ago a daughter was born to
the nuptials of Nevers, and that is why we are here
to-night. Monsieur Peyrolles would pretend that it
is the old marquis who is using us, the old marquis
who is suspicious of an amour between his daughter
and Nevers. But I know better."
</p>
<p>
"How do you know all this?" Cocardasse inquired.
</p>
<p>
Æsop shrugged his shoulders. "My good fellow,"
he said, "it is my business to know everything that
is worth knowing in my trade. There are very few
noble houses in France that can hope to hold any
secrets from me. You may take my word for it&mdash;that
is how matters stand."
</p>
<p>
Staupitz and his five swordsmen sat silent and puzzled,
leaving the ball of conversation to be tossed between
Cocardasse, Passepoil, and Æsop.
</p>
<p>
Cocardasse spoke next: "An ugly job. There&#8217;s
only one man alive to match Louis de Nevers."
</p>
<p>
Something almost approaching a human smile distorted
the wrinkled face of Æsop and made it appear
more than usually repulsive. "You mean me," he
said, and the smirk deepened, only to dissipate quickly
as Cocardasse replied:
</p>
<p>
"Devil a bit. I mean the little Parisian, Henri de
Lagardere."
</p>
<p>
"The best swordsman in Paris!" Passepoil cried,
enthusiastically.
</p>
<p>
"The best swordsman in France!" Cocardasse
shouted.
</p>
<p>
Passepoil commented again: "The best swordsman
in Europe."
</p>
<p>
Cocardasse, not to be outdone, put the final touch
to the picture: "The best swordsman in the world."
</p>
<p>
The name of Lagardere seemed to make a marked
impression upon the company. Every man seemed
to have his contribution to make to the history of
the little Parisian.
</p>
<p>
Faenza was the first to speak.
</p>
<p>
"I met your Lagardere once," he said, "at a fencing-school
in Milan, where half a dozen French gentlemen
met half a dozen gentlemen of my nationality
in a match to test the merits of the French and
Italian methods of fence. This Lagardere of yours
was the only one whom I had any difficulty in overcoming."
</p>
<p>
Cocardasse gave an ironic snort. It was evident
that he did not in the least believe the latter part
of Faenza&#8217;s narrative. Joel de Jurgan took up the
thread of reminiscence.
</p>
<p>
"If your Lagardere be the same as the man I am
thinking of," he said, "I came across him a couple
of years ago at the fair of Neuilly. We had a passage
of arms, and I think I gave him a cut on the head, but
it took me some time, I promise you."
</p>
<p>
Cocardasse glared at the speaker, but said nothing,
though the word "liar" was plainly expressed in his
scornful glance. Joel, impressed by his angry face,
hastened to add, with the air of one that praises an
adversary in the handsomest manner, "I swear he
was the best fellow, second to myself, that I ever
met with the rapier."
</p>
<p>
"I have met him," grunted Staupitz. "He touched
me once in a bout of twelve points. That was a
triumph for him, to my thinking."
</p>
<p>
Pepe added: "He fought with me once in Madrid,
and got off without a scratch. That says a good deal
for his skill, I&#8217;m thinking."
</p>
<p>
Saldagno and Pinto were silent. They looked curiously
at Pepe, but they nodded their heads approvingly.
</p>
<p>
Thus each of the bravos had his eager tale to
tell, and would have told more but that Cocardasse
waved them into silence with his large hand. "There
is only one Lagardere," he said, and looked as if the
subject were ended.
</p>
<p>
Æsop yawned. "I should like to meet your Lagardere."
</p>
<p>
Cocardasse eyed him ironically. "Sword in hand?"
he questioned. "When that day comes, pray for your
soul."
</p>
<p>
Æsop shrugged his shoulders, and with an air of
indifference produced a watch and consulted its dial.
"Friends," he said, "this is the hour fixed for the
arrival of Monsieur Peyrolles, and I think I hear
footsteps in the passage."
</p>
<p>
Instantly the Gascon seemed animated by a hurried
purpose. He sprang to Staupitz&#8217;s side, and,
catching him by the shoulder, shook him vehemently.
"We must be well paid to face the thrust of Nevers.
Let me bargain for you. Back me up, and those that
are alive to-night will have money in pocket to-morrow."
</p>

<h2>III</h2>
<h3>A BUYER OF BLADES</h3>
</div>

<p>
Staupitz and his companions seemed to place
implicit confidence in the superior diplomatic
powers of their Gascon comrade, and to have been
seriously impressed by the gravity of his statement
concerning the thrust of Nevers, so death-dealing, so
unwardable, so almost magically fatal, for they readily
agreed to his proposition. Places were rapidly
found for Cocardasse and Passepoil at the table.
Æsop returned to his seat and his little sinful book.
It was deepening dusk by now, but the hunchback
knew his Aretino by heart, and the open page was a
pretence. So he mused by the window, and sat
nursing his knee moodily. Those at the table seemed
busy drinking, and heedless of all things save drink,
when the side-door of the room, that led through the
kitchen to the yard, opened, and the man they were
expecting entered. It was characteristic of the man
to make his appearance so slyly, surreptitiously,
sidling, and roundabout, where another would have
stepped in direct. At the heels of the new-comer
tiptoed Martine, swinging, for precaution against the
thickening dusk, a dingy lantern whose provision of
fish-oil emitted a pitiful light that scarcely bettered
the growing blackness. This lantern the girl set
upon the head of an empty barrel that stood in a
corner, and its fitful, shivering rays, faintly illuminating
the murkiness around, was at least strong enough
to allow any philosopher among the bravos&mdash;and
Æsop was in his way a philosopher&mdash;to observe and
moralize upon the contrast between the appearance
of this Monsieur Peyrolles who employed bravos and
the bravos that this Monsieur Peyrolles employed.
</p>
<p>
Monsieur Peyrolles was a tall, thin, middle-aged
man of pale complexion. Like Æsop and like Passepoil,
he was dressed in black, as became the confidential
servant of a master with many confidences;
but, unlike the amorous Æsop and unlike the amorous
Passepoil&mdash;though the two men were amorous
after a very different fashion&mdash;his garments were of
fine quality and fine cut, with much costly lace at his
yellow neck, and much costly lace about the wrists
of yellow hands that to a casual glance might, in
their affected ease, have passed for patrician. Like
Passepoil, he carried a sword, and, like Passepoil, he
knew how to use it, although, unlike Passepoil, he
was really of a timid disposition, and never engaged
in any encounter in which he was not certain that his
skill was far superior to that of his opponent.
</p>
<p>
He affected the manners of a fine gentleman, and
modelled himself as much as he dared upon the carriage
of his master, when his master was not by, and,
like the most of such copying apes, he overdid the
part. His face was curiously unpleasant, long and
yellowish white and inexpressive, with drooping eyelids
masking pale, shifty eyes, with a drooping, ungainly
nose, and a mouth that seemed like a mistake
of nature.
</p>
<p>
When Martine had placed her lantern to her satisfaction
upon its Bacchic pedestal, she slipped from
the room as quietly as she had entered it, answering
as she went, with a glance of disdain, the
passion of admiration that glowed in the eyes and
twitched in the fingers of Norman Passepoil. The
people that kept that evil Inn, the people that served
that evil Inn, always left their sinister customers to
themselves to kiss or kill, as best pleased them.
</p>
<p>
On the entrance of Monsieur Peyrolles the bravos
rose and saluted him ceremoniously. If there was
any hidden mockery, any latent contempt, any unconscious
hate felt by the brave scoundrels for the
cowardly scoundrel in their reverence, it was not evident
to the new-comer, who took the greetings with
offensive condescension, eying the bandits over the
lace edges of his kerchief.
</p>
<p>
Staupitz advanced some few feet to greet him.
"Welcome, Monsieur Peyrolles," he said. Then,
pointing with an air of introduction to the fantastic,
many-colored, huge-hatted, big-booted gang of ruffians
ranged about the table, he added, "My children."
</p>
<p>
In the dim light Peyrolles peered derisively at the
different members of the party. "They seem a
choice set of ruffians," he observed, with the labored
impertinence that seemed to him a copy of his master&#8217;s
nonchalance.
</p>
<p>
Staupitz laughed thickly. "No better blades between
here and world&#8217;s end." He pointed first at
his comrades, as if to imply that he spoke allegorically;
then he pointed to the row of rapiers dangling
against the wall, to prove that he also spoke
practically and by the card.
</p>
<p>
"After all," said Peyrolles, "that is the important
matter. I come to tell you how to earn your pay."
</p>
<p>
By this time Staupitz and the others had resumed
their seats and were staring fixedly at Peyrolles,
something to that worthy personage&#8217;s embarrassment.
Staupitz having said his say, dropped into
silence, and Cocardasse leaned forward, asserting himself.
"We are all attention," he declared; and Passepoil,
faithful echo by his side, murmured, "We are
all attention," and allowed himself to wonder what
had become of Martine, and to regret that business
did not permit him to go to look for her.
</p>
<p>
Peyrolles began to explain. "Wait in the moat
to-night at ten o&#8217;clock."
</p>
<p>
Staupitz interrupted him. "Ten o&#8217;clock?" he cried.
"The devil! it will be pretty dark by ten."
</p>
<p>
"I think there should be a moon about ten," Æsop
observed, quietly, with his exasperating air of all
knowledge.
</p>
<p>
"Yes, yes," Peyrolles went on, sharply, irritated
at being stayed in his instructions, "there will be a
moon, no doubt, but we do not want too much light
for this business. Well, then, wait in the moat at
ten. I do not think you will have to wait long.
Then, or thenabouts, a cavalier coming by the mountain
road will tie his horse to a tree beyond the bridge
that spans the ravine. He will cross the bridge and
walk to yonder window hard by the postern."
</p>
<p>
Peyrolles paused as if he had nothing more to say,
and took it for granted that his hearers understood
his drift. But one of them seemed to desire more
explicit information.
</p>
<p>
"Then," said Cocardasse&mdash;"then we are to accost
him."
</p>
<p>
Peyrolles nodded. "Very politely&mdash;and earn your
money." He turned upon his heel now, for he relished
the Inn room little, and its company less, being
a fastidious lackey, and made to go, as if the affair
were settled.
</p>
<p>
But Cocardasse arrested him. "Who is the gentleman
we accost politely?" he asked, very blandly,
but behind this blandness of Cocardasse&#8217;s there was
something menacing to those that knew him well.
</p>
<p>
Peyrolles eyed the huge Gascon disdainfully.
"That does not concern you," he said, sharply.
</p>
<p>
But the Gascon was not in the least abashed, and,
while he grinned at the would-be great man with
an air of veiled insolence that was excessively exasperating
to Monsieur Peyrolles, he questioned again:
"Who is our employer?"
</p>
<p>
Again Peyrolles retorted: "That does not concern
you."
</p>
<p>
And again Cocardasse persisted: "It might concern
us very much if we chanced to believe that our
quarry is Louis de Nevers, and if we got it somehow
or other into our heads that our employer is Louis
de Gonzague."
</p>
<p>
As Cocardasse spoke these words, Peyrolles, now
thoroughly alarmed and irritated, gave Cocardasse a
glance that ought to have withered him, but Cocardasse
was not withered, and smiled banteringly at
his employer.
</p>
<p>
"Fellow," Peyrolles said, "you are inquisitive."
As he spoke he flapped his kerchief reprovingly at
the bravo, whose dilated nostrils greedily drank the
delicate odors it discharged, and he again made as if
to depart, and again Cocardasse delayed him, still
with the same exasperating show of exuberant politeness.
</p>
<p>
"When it is a matter of our skins," he said, "I
think we have a right to be inquisitive, and I think
we had better have a little chat, Monsieur Peyrolles."
</p>
<p>
As he spoke he made a noble flourish of his right
arm that was distinctly an invitation to Peyrolles to
seat himself in their company, and Passepoil, rising
with an air of great urbanity, placed a stool before
Peyrolles.
</p>
<p>
"Pray be seated," he urged, suavely, blinking his
pink eyelids and manifesting a deferential fear of
the great man that he was very far indeed from feeling.
</p>
<p>
Peyrolles looked about him half angrily, half
frightened. He would have been glad to make his
escape from that accursed chamber, but he had
astuteness enough to see that there was no escape
for him. Cocardasse had somehow or other managed
to get between him and the door, and the other
ruffians seemed to be entirely in sympathy with the
Gascon&#8217;s conduct, and to have no regard whatever
for Peyrolles&#8217;s dignity or feelings.
</p>
<p>
With a smile that he intended to be amiable, Peyrolles
sat down.
</p>
<p>
"Well," he said, with an air of one that swallows
sour wine, "what have you to say to me?"
</p>
<p>
"Come," said the Gascon, "that is good. Now we
can chat at our ease, and it will not take us many
seconds to understand each other, I promise you."
He turned to Staupitz. "What was the sum offered
for our services?" He knew very well, for Staupitz
had told him as they huddled together before, while
the hand of Peyrolles was upon the latch, but he
thought that it made the situation more impressive
if he affected ignorance.
</p>
<p>
Staupitz answered: "Three hundred pistoles."
</p>
<p>
Now this was a fair market price enough as the
tariff went for ambuscades and assassinations of the
kind. It meant twenty-five pistoles each to the
eight subordinates of the band, and a comfortable
hundred pistoles for old Papa Staupitz to pocket as
the patron of the enterprise. But Cocardasse held
up his hands in well-affected horror and amazement.
"Three hundred pistoles!" he echoed; "for ruddling
the blades and risking the lives of nine of the finest
swordsmen in Europe? Preposterous!&mdash;there must
be some mistake! We won&#8217;t haggle. We must have
three thousand pistoles or&mdash;good-bye."
</p>
<p>
At this audacious proposal to raise their blood-wages
exactly ten times, the eyes of the bravos glittered
avariciously, and they drummed approval on
the table with their fists. Cocardasse deprecated
this display of interest with a gentle wave of the
hand, and, leaning back in his chair, eyed Peyrolles
coolly, sure that he plied him with a vise. And Cocardasse
was right.
</p>
<p>
Peyrolles hesitated, but also Peyrolles reflected.
It had been his wish to buy his bandits as cheaply as
he could, but it was evident that they were better
informed about the night&#8217;s business than he intended
them to be. It was essential that the work must be
done that night, and it was also evident that the
gentlemen of the sword were quite prepared to take
their leaves if their terms were not agreed to. He
sighed and said, "You shall have the money."
</p>
<p>
Cocardasse nodded approvingly. He was enjoying
himself immensely in this baiting of the valet of Gonzague,
but he allowed no sign of entertainment to
ripple over his crimson countenance.
</p>
<p>
"Good," he said, quietly, "but I take it that you
have not got such a sum as three thousand pistoles
about you."
</p>
<p>
Peyrolles shook his head. "I have brought with
me the three hundred pistoles that were agreed upon,"
he said, sourly, with an emphasis upon the closing
words of his speech. Cocardasse caught him up
promptly.
</p>
<p>
"Agreed upon in ignorance of the services demanded,"
he corrected. "Well, good Monsieur Peyrolles,
let us have that three hundred pistoles as earnest
money for the larger sum."
</p>
<p>
Somewhat reluctantly Monsieur Peyrolles produced
from his doublet a small canvas bag and threw it into
the hollow of Cocardasse&#8217;s extended palm. It chinked
pleasantly as it fell, and Cocardasse weighed it tenderly.
</p>
<p>
"I will not affront your worthiness," he said, "by
affecting to doubt the contents of this little bag, and
putting it to the scrutiny of a count. I will take your
word for the tale."
</p>
<p>
As he spoke he tossed the bag over to Staupitz,
who caught it dexterously and put it in his pocket.
On this Peyrolles made to rise, and again found that
the hand of Passepoil, obedient to a glance from
Cocardasse, descended upon his shoulder and nailed
him to his place.
</p>
<p>
"Wait," said Cocardasse, amiably, "we must have
some surety for the lave of the money."
</p>
<p>
"Is not my word enough?" Peyrolles asked, with
an ineffective air of dignity. Cocardasse smiled very
sweetly.
</p>
<p>
"The best of us may have a bad memory," he said,
and sighed over the frailties of humanity. He turned
to his nominal leader. "Papa Staupitz," he said,
"will you not see if a pen and ink be available?"
</p>
<p>
Staupitz rose while Peyrolles glowered, and going
to the door that led to the kitchen, summoned Martine.
Martine, heedless of the adoring homage renewed
in Passepoil&#8217;s eyes, went to a cupboard in the
wall and extracted from its depths a dingy ink-horn
and a stubby quill, together with a page of fairly
clean paper torn from the back of an old account-book.
Setting these on the table, she departed as
quietly as she came, wholly indifferent to the languishing
glances of the Norman. Cocardasse waved
a space for Peyrolles at the table.
</p>
<p>
"Be so good," he said, with a quiet insistence, "as
to write a formal promise to pay Papa Staupitz two
thousand seven hundred pistoles to-morrow. Date
it carefully, and sign it with your excellent and honorable
name, my dear Monsieur Peyrolles."
</p>
<p>
Peyrolles frowned, but there was no help for it; so
he rose to his feet, untroubled this time by the restraining
fingers of Passepoil, and, going to the table,
wrote the demanded document, with every appearance
of repugnance at the task and its conditions,
for the pen was vile, the ink viler, and the paper
vilest. When he had finished, Cocardasse took it
from him and scanned it carefully.
</p>
<p>
"That is all right," he said, and placed the still
wet writing on the table in front of Staupitz. Peyrolles
made as if to move towards the door, but again
Passepoil, who was watching intently the face of Cocardasse,
read a meaning there, and, pouncing upon
Peyrolles, persuaded him firmly back into the seat
he had quitted.
</p>
<p>
"That is not all," said Cocardasse to the astonished
and angry valet. "This night&#8217;s work is a big night&#8217;s
work, and not to be paid for over the counter and
done with. We want the money first, but afterwards
we want the protection and favor of Louis de
Gonzague."
</p>
<p>
Peyrolles frowned and made a vehement effort to
assert his authority.
</p>
<p>
"You talk very freely and loosely of great names,"
he said, with as much sharpness as he could muster
in the presence of that ring of rascality. "You
should know very well, if you know anything at all
about the scandals of grandees, that Monseigneur the
Marquis of Caylus has every reason to dislike Monseigneur
the Duke of Nevers, and to wish him out of
the way."
</p>
<p>
Cocardasse laid a whimsical finger to the side of his
jolly, tropical nose and grinned impishly.
</p>
<p>
"We know what we know, Monsieur Peyrolles,"
he said, urbanely. "If it were merely necessary to
kill the Duke of Nevers to gratify the hate of any
private enemy, one place would do as well as another,
and we might take him any time on his way
here, instead of waiting till the precise moment when
he enters the moat of Caylus. But you wish us to
wait for that precise moment because you, and your
master, wish it to seem patent to all the world that
the deed was done by the Marquis of Caylus on his
own ground, to defend his own honor. Once again,
we demand hereafter the favor and protection of his
highness the Prince of Gonzague."
</p>
<p>
This time Peyrolles needed no pause for reflection.
So much was wise to promise to men who could draw
conclusions so dexterously. "You shall have it," he
said, and rose from his seat, this time unrestrained
by the Norman&#8217;s pressure. "There is my hand on
it," he added.
</p>
<p>
Cocardasse appeared not to perceive the extended
hand as he slapped the hilt of his sword. "Here is
my rapier, which answers for me."
</p>
<p>
Peyrolles smiled sourly. "You had better place
a sentinel in the moat," he said, addressing Staupitz.
"He can give the signal when the mouse walks into
the trap. Till then let the others keep in the background
so as to cut off our gentleman&#8217;s retreat."
</p>
<p>
Staupitz nodded sulkily. He had always held
Monsieur Peyrolles in considerable respect, a respect
that had been greatly shaken by Cocardasse&#8217;s audacious
and insolent treatment of the satellite of
Gonzague. Now the bravo seemed ready to resent
receiving an order from his employer&#8217;s go-between.
Peyrolles prudently took no notice of his sullenness.
"Good-evening, gentlemen," he said, and walked
towards the door. As he reached it, he turned again
and spoke significantly: "Remember&mdash;if you fail,
no pay."
</p>
<p>
Cocardasse grinned impudently at him. "Sleep in
peace, Monsieur Peyrolles." Peyrolles made a wry
face and went out.
</p>
<p>
As soon as he had gone the bravos gathered about
Cocardasse and patted him enthusiastically on the
back. Only Æsop remained in his corner, apparently
indifferent to the whole proceedings.
</p>
<p>
"Well done, comrade," cried Passepoil, wringing
the hand of his brother-in-arms; and the others,
whose pay had been so notably increased by the
diplomacy of Cocardasse, were equally as effusive in
their expressions of gratitude.
</p>
<p>
Cocardasse met their applause with an impressive
monosyllable. "Wine," he said to Martine, who
had peeped in to see if her services were needed, and
in a twinkling the pannikins were filled again and
lifted to eight thirsty mouths, and set down again
empty of their contents. The first business was
to share the contents of Monsieur Peyrolles&#8217;s bag,
which Staupitz duly divided according to the
original understanding, giving each man twenty-five
pistoles, and keeping the remainder for himself. By
this time the ink on the promissory note was dry,
and Staupitz folded it up carefully and put it in his
pocket.
</p>
<p>
After this for another half-hour the talk was all
about the young Duke de Nevers and his secret
thrust, and the woman he loved, and the Prince de
Gonzague, his friend, who meant to kill him. Here,
as before, Æsop dominated the party by his superior
knowledge of all the individuals in the little tragedy
in which they were invited to play subordinate parts.
He told them of the life feud between the family of
Caylus and the family of Nevers, a feud as bitter
as that of the Capulets and Montagues of old time.
He told them of Gonzague&#8217;s passions, Gonzague&#8217;s
poverty. He told them all about Monsieur Peyrolles,
Gonzague&#8217;s discreet and infamous factotum.
He told them, also, being as it seemed a very gold-mine
of court scandals, much of the third Louis, the
august friend of Louis of Nevers and Louis of
Gonzague, the third Louis who was the king of
France.
</p>
<p>
The bravos hung upon his words. In many ways
they were simple folk, and, like all simple folk, they
loved to be told stories, and Æsop prided himself
upon being something of a man of letters, a
philosopher, and an historian. It was, therefore, no
small annoyance to narrator and audience when
the narrative was interrupted, as it was nearing its
conclusion, by the opening of the Inn door. Every
face expressed astonishment as it was pushed sufficiently
apart to admit the entry of a slender and
graceful boy in the rich habit of a page. The boy
came a little way into the room, looking cautiously
about him. He acted as if at first he took the room
in its dimness to be unoccupied, and he seemed to be
somewhat disconcerted at discovering that it contained
so many occupants. He stood still while his
bright eyes ran rapidly, and indeed fearfully, over the
somewhat alarming features of the guests. Failing,
apparently, to find among them the person, whoever
it was, whom he had come there to seek, he
turned to leave as quietly as he had entered, but
his egress was barred by Æsop, who had slipped between
him and the door, and who now questioned
him, with a grin of malignant intelligence on his
face.
</p>
<p>
"Whom are you looking for, pygmy?"
</p>
<p>
The page put a bold face on it and answered
with a bold voice: "I have a letter for a gentleman."
</p>
<p>
Æsop pointed to the group at the table. "We are
all gentlemen. Let&#8217;s have a look at your letter."
Then he added to his companions: "It may be useful.
The imp wears the livery of Nevers."
</p>
<p>
Instantly the others approved by signs and grunts
of Æsop&#8217;s action, and the page, now really alarmed,
made a desperate effort to escape. "Let me pass!"
he cried, and tried to rush under Æsop&#8217;s arm. But
Æsop caught the boy in an iron grip, and, though the
courageous page drew a dagger and tried to stab his
assailant, he was disarmed in a second and seized
by the others, who sprang from the table and clustered
about him, fierce birds of prey about a helpless quarry.
The lad cried for help, hopelessly enough. Strong,
dirty fingers were tearing open his jerkin and fumbling
for the concealed letter, when suddenly it seemed
to the astonished swordsmen that an earthquake and
a whirlwind had combined for their undoing. Æsop
rolled to one end of the room, Staupitz to another;
Cocardasse and Passepoil, Saldagno, Pepe, Pinto,
Faenza, and Joel were scattered like sparrows, and
the little page found himself liberated and crouching
at the feet of a man who was standing with folded
arms surveying the discomfited bravos mockingly.

<h3>THE LITTLE PARISIAN</h3>
</div>

<p>
The new-comer was a young man of little over
one-and-twenty, of medium height, but with
a well-built, well-knit figure that gave a promise
of extraordinary strength and power of endurance,
coupled at the same time with a scarcely less extraordinary
suppleness. He had a face that was certainly
handsome, though many handsomer faces were familiar
in Paris at that day, but none more gallant, and,
indeed, its chief charm was its almost audacious
air of self-reliance, of unfailing courage, of changeless
composure, and unconquerable humor. The eyes
were bright and laughing. Even now, although the
man was undoubtedly angry, his eyes still smiled in
unison with his lips. His dark hair fell gracefully
about his shoulders. He wore a somewhat faded
white coat, girdled with a crimson sash&mdash;the white
coat of a captain in the king&#8217;s Light-Horse&mdash;and,
though he carried himself with an easy dignity, the
general condition of his dress showed he was one who
was neither afraid of nor unfamiliar with poverty.
Now he looked around him with a bright defiance,
seemingly diverted by the havoc his single pair of
arms and legs&mdash;for he had used both limbs in the
brawl&mdash;had wrought among nine swashbucklers, and
apparently prepared at any moment to repeat the
performance, if occasion called for action.
</p>
<p>
It was curious to observe that, though the new-comer
had worked such confusion among the bravos
whom he had taken so roughly unawares, he did not
show any sign of having passed through a scuffle
with a number of men or having accomplished anything
especially arduous in bringing them so swiftly
to discomfiture. His breathing was not quickened,
his comely young face was unflushed. As he stood
there lightly poised in an easy attitude that might
at any moment be resolved into an attitude of defence,
he seemed, to such of his spectators as had
sufficiently recovered their senses to look at him
coolly, rather to resemble one that had come in
on the heels of a tuss and was watching its result
with unconcerned eyes than one that with no more
assistance than his own agile limbs had been the
cause of humiliation to so many powerful adversaries.
Staupitz, blinking fiercely as he rubbed his aching
head, which had rattled sharply against the table
that arrested his flight across the room, was too bewildered
to swear out the oaths that were frothing
within him when he realized that the earthquake,
the whirlwind, the cataclysm that had tumbled him
and his companions about like so many nine-pins was
no other and no more than the slim and pleasant
young gentleman who stood there so composedly.
While the bewildered ruffians were picking themselves
up, and with some little difficulty recovering
their breath, the young gentleman addressed them
mockingly: "Are there quite enough of you to manage
this adversary?" And as he spoke he pointed to the
little page who was huddled at his feet.
</p>
<p>
Æsop was the first of the bravos to recover his
troubled senses and to seek to retaliate upon his
assailant. He whipped his long rapier from its
sheath, and was making for the intruder when Cocardasse
flung his strong arms around the hunchback
and restrained him. "Be easy," he cried; "it
is the little Parisian!" And at the same moment
Passepoil, with the gesture of one who salutes in a
fencing-school, exclaimed the name "Lagardere."
</p>
<p>
As for the other ruffians, they gathered together
sulkily enough about the table, staring at the stranger.
His face was familiar to all of them, and there was
not one among them bold enough to follow the
example of Æsop. Lagardere, who had taken no
notice of the threatened attack of the hunchback,
surveyed the group, and, glancing from them, addressed
himself to Cocardasse and Passepoil.
</p>
<p>
"Why, my old masters," he asked, drolling them,
"what are you doing in this desperate adventure?
You ought to be careful. The boy might have hurt
you." His eyes turned from the Gascon and the
Norman back again to the fellows at the table.
"Some of these scarecrows seem familiar." His
glance rested on Staupitz, and he questioned him:
"Where have we met?"
</p>
<p>
Staupitz saluted Lagardere very respectfully as
he answered: "At Lyons."
</p>
<p>
Lagardere seemed to search his memory and to
find what he sought. "True. You touched me once."
</p>
<p>
Staupitz made an apologetic gesture. "Only once
in twelve times."
</p>
<p>
Lagardere turned to Saldagno, Pepe, and Pinto.
"Ah, my bandits of Madrid, who tried me, three to
one."
</p>
<p>
Saldagno was more apologetic than Staupitz, with
a Latin profusion of gesture, as he explained: "That
was for a wager, captain."
</p>
<p>
Lagardere shrugged his shoulders. "Which you
did not win." He turned to Joel de Jurgan. "Does
your head still carry my cut?"
</p>
<p>
The Breton lifted a large hand to his bullet head
and fumbled through the thick hair for a familiar
spot. "There is a scar," he admitted.
</p>
<p>
Lagardere turned to the Italian. "Do you still,"
he asked, "hold the Italian school to be superior to
the French?"
</p>
<p>
Faenza shook his head. "Not when you practise
the French method," he answered, politely.
</p>
<p>
There was a little pause, and then Æsop, who had
by this time been released from the embrace of
Cocardasse, and had sheathed his sword, came forward
and faced Lagardere. "I desire acquaintanceship,
Captain Lagardere. Men call me Æsop."
</p>
<p>
Lagardere gazed at the hunchback, and a look of
displeasure banished the mirth from his eyes. "I
have heard of you," he said, curtly. "A good sword
and a bad heart. I don&#8217;t like the blend. You may
go to the devil."
</p>
<p>
He turned away from Æsop and bent over the
lad, who still crouched at his feet. "Now, lad, you
must promise not to hurt these gentlemen, for some
of them are friends of mine."
</p>
<p>
While the bravos tried not to appear annoyed by
Lagardere&#8217;s banter, which, indeed, in its simplicity
vexed their simple natures greatly, the page rose to
his feet and whispered softly to his rescuer, "I have
a letter for you from the Duke de Nevers."
</p>
<p>
Lagardere extended his hand. "Give it," he said.
</p>
<p>
The page produced the letter, of which Æsop had
been so anxious to gain possession, and handed it to
Lagardere, whispering as he did so, "Save me from
these ogres. I carry another letter to a lady."
</p>
<p>
Lagardere smiled. "To Gabrielle de Caylus, I&#8217;ll
swear," he murmured in a low voice which was calculated
only to reach the page&#8217;s ears. Then he turned
again to the swordsmen. "Sirs, this lad, more fastidious
than I, dislikes your society. Pray respect
his prejudices." He pushed the page gently towards
the main door. "Hop, skip, jump!"
</p>
<p>
In a moment the page had glided out of the room.
Æsop made a movement as if he were inclined to
follow, but any such intention was frustrated by
Lagardere, who shut the door after the boy and
stood with his back towards it. "Stay where you
are, gentlemen," he said, and there was something
so persuasive in the way in which he said it that the
gentlemen stayed where they were. Then Lagardere,
as if he had almost forgotten their presence, slowly
walking down the room till he paused in the middle,
opened the letter and began to read it. As he seemed
absorbed by its contents, Staupitz on the one side
and Æsop on the other came cautiously towards him
with the intention of reading the letter over his
shoulder, but Lagardere&#8217;s seeming forgetfulness of
their presence instantly changed. He looked up
sharply, glancing right and left, and Æsop and Staupitz
fell back in confusion, while Lagardere spoke
to them, mocking them: "You will dub me eccentric;
you will nickname me whimsical; you will damn me
for a finicking stickler, and all because I am such an
old-fashioned rascal as to wish to keep my correspondence
to myself. There, there, don&#8217;t be crestfallen.
This letter makes me so merry that you
shall share its treasure. But, first, fill and drink
with me, a noble toast."
</p>
<p>
To suggest drinking was to forge a link between the
bravos and the man who down-faced them so masterfully.
The big jug seemed to jump from hand to
hand, every mug was full in a twinkling, and every
face was fixed steadfastly on Lagardere, waiting for
his words. Lagardere lifted his brimming beaker
with a voice of joyous mockery that carried at once
defiance and respect to a distant man. "The health
of Louis of Nevers!" he said, and drained his green
wine as cheerfully as if it had been the elixir of the
gods.
</p>
<p>
At his words blank astonishment spread over the
faces of the Gascon and the Norman. "He said
&#8217;Nevers,&#8217;" Cocardasse whispered to Passepoil, and
Passepoil whispered back, "He did." As for the
other bravos, they had been as much surprised as
Cocardasse and Passepoil by Lagardere&#8217;s request, but
they managed to conceal their surprise by lifting
their mugs, and now as they nodded and winked to
one another, they tilted their vessels and drank,
shouting, "The health of Louis de Nevers!"
</p>
<p>
Cocardasse came nearer to Lagardere, and said in
a voice that was almost a whisper, "Why do you
drink the health of Louis de Nevers?"
</p>
<p>
Lagardere looked for a moment annoyed at the
presumption of Cocardasse in questioning him, then
the annoyance gave place to his familiar air of
tolerant amusement. "I don&#8217;t love questions, but
you have a kind of right to query." He turned to
the others. "You must know, sirs, that this pair
of rapiers were my fairy godfathers in the noble art
of fence."
</p>
<p>
The Norman looked at Lagardere with a very loving
expression. "You were a sad little rag of humanity
when first you came to our fencing-academy."
</p>
<p>
"You are right there," said Lagardere. "I was
the poorest, hungriest scrap of mankind in all Paris.
I had neither kin nor friends nor pence, nothing but
a stout heart and a sense of humor. That is why
I came to your academy, old rogues."
</p>
<p>
Cocardasse was reminiscent. "Faith, you looked
droll enough, with your pale face and your shabby
clothes. &#8217;I want to be a soldier,&#8217; says you; &#8217;I want
to use the sword.&#8217;"
</p>
<p>
Lagardere nodded. "That was my stubborn law.
The world laughed at me, but I laughed at the world,
and I won my wish."
</p>
<p>
"Just think of it!" said Cocardasse. "Henri de
Lagardere, a gentleman born, without a decent
relative, without a decent friend, without a penny,
making his livelihood as a strolling player in the
booth of a mountebank."
</p>
<p>
While Cocardasse was speaking, Lagardere seemed
to listen like a man in a dream. He forgot for the
moment the reeking Inn room where he stood, the
beastly visages that surrounded him, the whimsy
that had drifted him thither. All these things were
forgotten, and the man that was little more than a
boy in years was in fancy altogether a boy again,
a shivering, quivering slip of a boy that stood on the
gusty high-road and knuckled his eyelids to keep his
eyes from crying. How long ago it seemed, that
time twelve years ago when a mutinous urchin fled
from a truculent uncle to seek his fortune as Heaven
might please to guide! Heaven guided an itinerant
mime and mountebank that tramped France with
his doxy to a wet hedge-side where a famished, foot-sore
scrap of a lad lay like a tired dog, trying not to
sob. The mountebank was curious, the mountebank&#8217;s
doxy was kind; both applauded lustily the boy&#8217;s resolve
to march to Paris, cost what it might cost, and
make his fortune there. The end of the curiosity and
the kindness and the applause was that the little
Lagardere found himself at once the apprentice and
the adopted son of the mountebank, with his fortune
as far off as the stars. But he learned many
things, the little Lagardere, under the care of that
same mountebank; all that the mountebank could
teach him he learned, and he invented for himself
tricks that were beyond the mountebank&#8217;s skill.
How long ago it seemed! Would ever space of time
seem so long again? So the young man mused
swiftly, while Cocardasse told his tale; but ere Cocardasse
had finished, Lagardere was back in the
tavern again, and, when Cocardasse had finished,
Lagardere caught him up: "Why not? Some actors
are as honest as bandits. I was no bad mummer,
sirs. I could counterfeit any one of you now so
that your mother wouldn&#8217;t know the cheat. And
my master made me an athlete, too; taught me every
trick of wrestling and tumbling and juggling with
the muscles. That is why I was able to tumble you
about so pleasantly just now. I should have been
a mountebank to this day but for an accident."
</p>
<p>
Passepoil was curious. "What accident?" he
asked.
</p>
<p>
Lagardere answered him: "A brawl over a wench
with a bully. I challenged him, though I was more
at home with a toasting-fork than a sword. I
caught up an unfamiliar weapon, but he nicked the
steel from my hand at a pass and banged me with
the flat of his blade. The girl laughed. The bully
grinned. I swore to learn swordcraft."
</p>
<p>
"And you did," said Passepoil. "In six months
you were our best pupil."
</p>
<p>
Cocardasse continued: "In twelve you were our
master."
</p>
<p>
Passepoil questioned again: "What became of your
bully?"
</p>
<p>
Lagardere was laconic: "We had a chat afterwards.
I attended his funeral."
</p>
<p>
Cocardasse clapped his hands. "Well begun, little
Parisian."
</p>
<p>
Passepoil pointed admiringly at Lagardere. "Look
at you now, a captain in the king&#8217;s guard."
</p>
<p>
Lagardere laughed cheerfully. "Look if you like,
but I am no such thing. I am cashiered, exiled from
Paris."
</p>
<p>
"Why?" asked Cocardasse, and Lagardere replied
with a question: "Do you remember the Baron de
Brissac?"
</p>
<p>
Cocardasse nodded. "One of the best swords in
Paris."
</p>
<p>
Lagardere resumed: "Well, the late baron&mdash;"
</p>
<p>
Passepoil interrupted: "The late baron?"
</p>
<p>
Lagardere explained: "Brissac had a lewd tongue
and smirched a woman. So I pulled his ears."
</p>
<p>
Cocardasse grinned. "The devil you did!"
</p>
<p>
"Yes," said Lagardere, "they were very long
and tempting. We resumed the argument elsewhere.
It was brief. Good-bye, Brissac! But as the good
king, thanks to the good cardinal, now frowns upon
duelling, I am exiled when I ought to be rewarded."
</p>
<p>
Cocardasse sighed. "There is no encouragement
for virtue nowadays."
</p>
<p>
Lagardere&#8217;s voice was as cheerful as if there were
no such thing in the world as exile. "Well, there I
was at my wit&#8217;s end, and my nimble wits found work
for me. &#8217;If I must leave France,&#8217; I said, &#8217;I will
go to Spain, where the spirit of chivalry still reigns.&#8217;
So I raised a regiment of adventurers like myself&mdash;broken
gentlemen, ruined spendthrifts, poor devils
out at elbow, gallant soldiers of fortune one and all.
They wait for me a mile from here. We shall find
work to do in Spain or elsewhere. The world is
wide, and it has always work for good swords to do."
</p>
<p>
Cocardasse looked at him admiringly. "Your
sword will never rust for want of use," he said, with
approval.
</p>
<p>
Lagardere answered him, briskly: "Why should
it? &#8217;Tis the best friend in the world. What woman&#8217;s
eye ever shone as brightly as its blade, what
woman&#8217;s tongue ever discoursed such sweet music?"
</p>
<p>
Cocardasse took off his hat and swung it. "Hurrah
for the sword!" he shouted.
</p>
<p>
Lagardere&#8217;s glance applauded his enthusiasm.
"Iron was God&#8217;s best gift to man, and he God&#8217;s good
servant who hammered it into shape and gave it
point and edge. I shall never be happy until I am
master of it."
</p>
<p>
Æsop joined the conversation mockingly. "I
thought you were master of it," he said, with an
obvious sneer.
</p>
<p>
Cocardasse and Passepoil looked horrified at the
hunchback&#8217;s impertinence, but Lagardere did not
seem to be vexed, and answered, quite amiably: "So
did I till lately." Then he said, addressing himself
generally to the company: "Have any of you ever
heard of the thrust of Nevers?"
</p>
<p>
A tremor of excitement ran through his audience.
Cocardasse took up the talk: "We spoke of it but
now."
</p>
<p>
"Well," said Lagardere, "what do you think of
it?"
</p>
<p>
Æsop, the irrepressible, thrust in his opinion.
"Never was secret thrust invented that cannot be
parried."
</p>
<p>
Lagardere looked at him somewhat contemptuously.
"So I thought till I crossed swords with
Nevers. Now I think differently."
</p>
<p>
Cocardasse whistled. "The devil you do," he commented.
</p>
<p>
"I will tell you all about it," said Lagardere. "It
happened three months ago. That secret thrust
piqued me. Then people talked too much about
Nevers; that irritated me. Wherever I went, from
court to camp, from tavern to palace, the name of
Nevers was dinned in my ears. The barber dressed
your hair à la Nevers. The tailor cut your coat à la
Nevers. Fops carried canes à la Nevers; ladies
scented themselves à la Nevers. One day at the inn
they served me cutlets à la Nevers. I flung the
damned dish out of the window. On the doorstep
I met my boot-maker, who offered to sell me a pair of
boots à la Nevers. I cuffed the rascal and flung him
ten louis as a salve. But the knave only said to me:
&#8217;Monsieur de Nevers beat me once, but he gave me
a hundred pistoles.&#8217;"
</p>
<p>
Passepoil sighed for the sorrows of his young pupil:
"Poor little Parisian!"
</p>
<p>
Lagardere went on with his tale: "Now I am
vainglorious enough to hold that cutlets would
taste good if they were cooked à la Lagardere; that
coats à la Lagardere would make good wearing, and
boots à la Lagardere good walking. I came to the
conclusion that Paris was not big enough for the
pair of us, and that Nevers was the man to quit the
field. Like Æsop yonder, I laughed at the secret
thrust."
</p>
<p>
He paused, and Cocardasse questioned: "But you
don&#8217;t laugh now?"
</p>
<p>
Lagardere answered him, gravely: "Not a laugh.
I waited for Nevers one evening outside the Louvre
and saluted him. &#8217;Sir,&#8217; I said, in my grandest manner,
&#8217;I rely upon your courtesy to give me a moonlight
lesson in your secret thrust.&#8217; Lord, how he
started. &#8217;Who the devil are you?&#8217; says he. I made
him a magnificent bow. &#8217;I am Henri de Lagardere,
of the king&#8217;s Light-Horse. I am always in trouble,
always in debt, always in love. These are misfortunes
a man can endure. But I am always hearing
of your merits, which is fretting, and of your irresistible
secret thrust, and that is unbearable.&#8217;"
</p>
<p>
Lagardere paused to give dramatic effect to the
point in his narrative.
</p>
<p>
"What did he say to that?" asked Passepoil.
</p>
<p>
Lagardere went on: "&#8217;Ah,&#8217; said the duke, &#8217;you are
the fellow they call handsome Lagardere&#8217;" (Lagardere
interrupted the flow of his story with a pathetic
parenthesis&mdash;"I can&#8217;t help it, they do call me so");
"&#8217;people talk too much about you, and that wearies
me&#8217;; which shows that he had a touch of my
complaint. Well, he was civility itself. We went
down by the church of St.-Germain, and had scarcely
crossed swords when the point of his rapier pricked
me here, just between the eyes. I was touched&mdash;I,
Lagardere&mdash;and if I had not leaped backward I
should have been a dead man. &#8217;That is my secret
thrust,&#8217; says the duke with a smile, and wished me
good-evening."

<h3>THE PARRY TO THE THRUST OF NEVERS</h3>
</div>

<p>
There was a heavy stillness in the room when
Lagardere came to the end of his tale. "This
sounds serious," Cocardasse said, gloomily, and those
about him were gloomily silent.
</p>
<p>
Lagardere resumed his story: "I pondered that
thrust for a month. At last I mastered it. I tried
it on the Baron de Brissac with perfect success."
</p>
<p>
A general laugh at this remark relieved the tension
of the bravos&#8217; nerves. Æsop took advantage
of the more cheerful atmosphere again to address
Lagardere. "Matchless cavalier," he asked, with
a wry assumption of politeness, "would you show
me that thrust you esteem so highly?"
</p>
<p>
Lagardere looked at the speaker with a whimsical
smile. "With pleasure," he said, and drew his sword.
Æsop did likewise, and while the bravos drew back
towards the wall to allow a free space for the lesson
the two swordsmen came on guard. Lagardere explained
while he fenced, naming each feint and lunge
and circle of the complicated attack as he made it.
With the last word of his steel-illuminated lecture
his sword, that had illustrated the words of the fencer,
seemed suddenly to leap forward, a glittering streak
of light.
</p>
<p>
Æsop leaped back with a yell, and clapped his
left hand to his forehead. "Damnation!" he cried.
</p>
<p>
Cocardasse, who had been following the proceedings
with the keenest attention, hurried out of the
circle of spectators. "Splendid!" he cried. "What
is the parry?"
</p>
<p>
"It is as clear as day," Lagardere answered. "This
is how the trick is done," and again, as he spoke, his
blade explained his text, gleaming and twisting in the
cunning evolutions of the riposte.
</p>
<p>
Cocardasse, who had drawn his own sword, repeated
Lagardere&#8217;s words and parodied Lagardere&#8217;s
gestures faithfully. "I see," he said, and turned to
the others, who had lost nothing of the lesson. "Have
you caught it, boys? It might serve&mdash;"
</p>
<p>
Lagardere interrupted him, indifferent to the evil
appreciation on the faces of the spectators. "It
will serve at once. I am going to try it on its master."
</p>
<p>
"On Nevers?" queried Staupitz, hoarsely.
</p>
<p>
Lagardere nodded. "On no less a man. I should
have told you that I plagued him until he promised
me my revenge. When I was exiled I wrote to remind
him." Lagardere drew a letter from his breast
and held it up for a moment before returning it to
its lodging. "In this letter he accepts my challenge,
names the time, the place&mdash;"
</p>
<p>
Cocardasse interrupted: "What time?"
</p>
<p>
"To-night at ten," Lagardere replied.
</p>
<p>
"The place?" asked Passepoil.
</p>
<p>
"The moat of Caylus," Lagardere answered. He
pointed to the window at which Æsop had been
sitting so long. "You can see it from that window."
</p>
<p>
There was a general look of astonishment on the
faces of all the bravos. Passepoil, quick with his
Norman caution, glanced at Staupitz and the group
about him, and put his finger cautiously to his lips.
</p>
<p>
Cocardasse was still inquisitive. "Why there?"
he questioned.
</p>
<p>
Lagardere explained, amiably: "Because such is
the good duke&#8217;s pleasure. When I sent him my
cartel I made it plain that I had little time on my
hands, as I was anxious, on account of the king&#8217;s
fire-new zeal against duelling, to cross the frontier as
speedily as might be. I knew the duke was staying
on his estates near by, and I suggested, with a fine
show of gravity, that possibly his highness was acquainted
with some quiet place in the neighborhood
of the Castle of Caylus where we might settle our
little difference. Oh, the words were solemnly
couched, but I swear to you that I laughed heartily
when I wrote them."
</p>
<p>
Lagardere laughed again in memory of that former
mirth as he made an end of speaking. Cocardasse
scratched an ear and glanced at Passepoil. Passepoil
scratched an ear and glanced at Cocardasse.
The rest of the bravos stared with a sullen curiosity
at Lagardere, who paid no heed to their gaze.
</p>
<p>
"Why did you laugh?" Cocardasse asked, after a
short pause.
</p>
<p>
Lagardere answered him affably: "Because I knew
that my allusion to Caylus would fret my excellent
enemy. There is, it seems, a beauty hidden in that
gloomy castle, Gabrielle de Caylus, whom my duke
adores in spite of the ancient feud between the two
houses of Caylus and Nevers. It should please him
to fight under the eyes of his lady love, whom I can
console if I win."
</p>
<p>
The idea seemed to please Lagardere, for he again
began to laugh softly to himself after he had finished
speaking. But Cocardasse did not seem to think it
was a laughing matter, for his voice was almost
solemn as he asked: "Did you speak of the lady in
your letter to Nevers?"
</p>
<p>
Lagardere interrupted his mirth to reply: "Of
course. The situation is so humorous. I suggested
playfully that there was a lovely princess imprisoned
in the castle of a wicked old ogre named Caylus,
and I hinted that if things turned out as I hoped,
I might be fortunate enough to carry solace and
freedom to the captive damsel." He paused for a
moment and then asked in wonder: "Why do you
pull such long faces?"
</p>
<p>
For, indeed, the faces of the swashbucklers were
almost funereal in their solemnity. Passepoil, relying
upon his Norman cunning, took it upon himself
to explain a ticklish situation. "It is lucky we are
here to help you," he said, knowingly.
</p>
<p>
Lagardere&#8217;s laughter became more pronounced.
"To help me?" he cried, and he shook with amusement
at the absurdity of the words.
</p>
<p>
Passepoil insisted: "It&#8217;s no laughing matter.
Nevers is the lady&#8217;s husband."
</p>
<p>
He spoke with a portentous solemnity against
which Lagardere protested, laughing louder than
before. "On the contrary, it is more laughable than
ever. A secret marriage. A romance. Perhaps I shall
have to soothe a widow when I hoped to woo a maid."
</p>
<p>
"Better have a sword or two to back you," Cocardasse
suggested, cunningly.
</p>
<p>
Lagardere frowned. "No, thank you. I do my
own fighting."
</p>
<p>
Passepoil whispered, insinuatingly: "Could I help
to carry off the lady?"
</p>
<p>
Lagardere&#8217;s frown deepened. "No, thank you. I
do my own love-making. Clear out and leave me
alone. That is all I want of you, my friends."
</p>
<p>
Cocardasse sighed. "I&#8217;d do anything in the
world to oblige you, but&mdash;" He paused and looked
helplessly at his former pupil, whom his faltering
speech, his hesitating manner began to anger.
</p>
<p>
"But what?" said Lagardere, sharply.
</p>
<p>
Cocardasse made an apologetic gesture. "Every
man to his trade. We also are waiting for some one."
</p>
<p>
Lagardere raised his eyebrows. "Indeed, and
that some one?"
</p>
<p>
The bravos looked at one another uneasily, trying
to seem devil-may-care and failing wofully. Nobody
appeared to want to speak. At last Passepoil
spoke. "That some one is Louis de Nevers," he
said, and wished heartily that he did not have to
say it.
</p>
<p>
Lagardere at first appeared to be puzzled by the
answer. Then the full meaning of it seemed to
fall upon him like a blow, and his face blazed at the
insult. "Nevers! You! Ah, this is an ambuscade,
and I have sat at drink with assassins!"
</p>
<p>
Cocardasse protested: "Come, captain, come."
</p>
<p>
Lagardere&#8217;s only answer was to spring back clear
of the nearest swordsmen and to draw his sword
again. The bravos gathered together angrily about
Staupitz, buzzing like irritated bees.
</p>
<p>
Lagardere flung his comely head back, and his
bright eyes flamed with a royal rage. His words
came quick and clear in his anger: "It was for
this you sought to learn Nevers&#8217;s thrust, and I&mdash;Oh,
it would make the gods laugh to think that I
taught it to you! You have the best of the joke
so far, excellent assassins, but if any one of you
touches a hair of Nevers&#8217;s head he will find that the
joke is two-edged, like my sword. If Nevers must
die, it shall be in honorable battle and by my hands,
but not by yours, while Lagardere lives."
</p>
<p>
Æsop commented, sneeringly: "Lagardere is not
immortal."
</p>
<p>
Staupitz grunted, angrily: "Shall one man dictate
to nine?" and made an appealing gesture to his
comrades, inciting them against their censor.
</p>
<p>
Lagardere faced their menaces with the contemptuous
indifference with which a mastiff might
have faced as many rats. He commanded, imperiously:
"Pack off, the whole gang of you, and leave
Nevers to me!"
</p>
<p>
The bravos still buzzed and grumbled: Cocardasse
rubbed his chin thoughtfully; Passepoil
pinched his long nose. The situation was becoming
critical. Lagardere was Lagardere, but he was only
one man, after all, in a narrow room, against great
odds. Truly, the odds would be diminished if the
quarrel came to actual blows, for Cocardasse was
resolved, and he knew that Passepoil was resolved
also, to side with Lagardere in such an emergency.
But even with the situation thus altered the result
could only be unnecessary bloodshed, which would be
bad, for, if Lagardere was their dear Little Parisian,
the others were also their comrades. Further, it
would mean the postponing, probably the abandonment,
of their enterprise against Nevers, which would
be much worse. Cocardasse plucked the Norman to
him with a strong finger and thumb, and whispered
in his ear: "Get the boys away and shift the keys."
</p>
<p>
Passepoil nodded, and glided discreetly among the
bravos huddled together at the table, whispering
the words of Cocardasse in the ears of each.
</p>
<p>
Lagardere frowned at this mystery. "What are
you whispering?" he asked, angrily.
</p>
<p>
Cocardasse explained, plausibly. "Only that if you
wanted to keep Nevers to yourself&mdash;"
</p>
<p>
Passepoil interrupted, concluding: "It mattered little
who did the job."
</p>
<p>
By this time the bravos, who at the beginning
of the quarrel had unhooked their rapiers from the
wall, were now pulling their cloaks about them
and making for the main door. The Italian, the
Breton, the Spaniard, the Biscayan, and the Portuguese
filed out into the passage, followed by Æsop,
who turned to pay Lagardere a mocking salutation
and to say, tauntingly: "So good-night, gallant captain."
</p>
<p>
Staupitz, with an air of surly carelessness, sauntered
down to the only other door in the room, the door
that led to the domestic offices of the Inn. While
he did so, Cocardasse held out his hand to Lagardere
in sign of amity, but Lagardere refused it. "I am
no precisian," he said. "I have kept vile company.
I would not deny my hand to a hang-man. But the
most tolerant philosopher has his dislikes, and mine
are assassins."
</p>
<p>
Cocardasse sighed, and made for the main door,
followed by Passepoil, who said, wistfully, "Adieu,
Little Parisian," a greeting of which Lagardere took
no notice.
</p>
<p>
Now, while Æsop had been saying his taunting
farewell to Lagardere he had been standing with
his back to the door, and with his left hand had dexterously
abstracted the key. Also, while Cocardasse
had been endeavoring to gain a clasp of the hand
from Lagardere, Staupitz had quietly locked the
door leading to the kitchen and put that key in his
pocket. Now Staupitz, Cocardasse, and Passepoil
went in their turn through the main door and drew
it behind them.
</p>
<p>
Lagardere seated himself at the table with a sigh
of relief as he heard the heavy feet trampling down
the passage, but his relief did not last long. His
quick ears caught a sound that was undoubtedly the
click of a key in a lock, followed by the shuffle of
cautiously retiring feet. He instantly sprang to his
feet, and, rushing to the main door, caught at the
handle and found the door firmly locked.
</p>
<p>
"Damn them!" he cried; "they have locked the
door." Then he began to shout, furiously, calling
first upon Cocardasse, and then upon Passepoil by
name to open the door immediately, knowing these
two to be his friends among the gang of rascals. But
no answer came to his cries, and, vigorous though he
was, his efforts had no effect upon the solid strength
of the door. Turning, he hurried to the door which
led to the kitchen and tried that, only to find that it,
too, was locked against him, and that it, too, was
impregnable. He looked about him hurriedly. He
knew it was no use calling for the people of the Inn,
who would be sure to side with their truculent customers,
and he knew also that, if he did not succeed
in making his escape from the trap into which he
had blundered, Nevers would be murdered.
</p>
<p>
He rushed to the window and looked out. The
sight was not pleasing. The rugged rock on which
the Inn was perched dropped beneath him thirty
feet to the moat below, and, though his eyes eagerly
scanned the face of the cliff, he could see no possibility,
even for one so nimble as himself, of climbing down
it successfully. To jump such a height would be to
end as a jelly and be of no service to Nevers. For
a few wild moments he cursed his folly in having
been deluded by the bravos, and then his native
high spirits and his native humor came to his assistance,
reminding him that he always made it his
business to look upon the diverting side of life, and
that it was now clearly his duty to seek for the entertaining
elements of the present predicament. Undoubtedly,
these were hard to find. The jest was
decidedly a bitter one, and could only be turned to
his taste if he succeeded in getting out. But how was
he to succeed? He tried the door again, despairingly
and unsuccessfully as before. He reflected that perhaps
there might be a rope in the room, and anxiously
he looked in every corner. No rope was to be found.
</p>
<p>
Clapping his hands to his sides in his vexation at
being thus baffled, he touched the soft substance of
his silken sash, and instantly an idea kindled at the
touch. "Perhaps this will do," he thought, and
hurriedly proceeded to unwind it. It was a long
sash, for it went from his shoulder to his waist and
then three times round his middle, where it was tied
in a large bow with long ends. It was at least fifteen
feet long, and as tough as any hemp that was ever
twisted. He fastened one end of it quickly round a
bar in the window, and let the long crimson streamer
drop down the side of the cliff. Using this as a
means of descent, it would bring him half-way down
the rock. Hanging by his arms, he would cover
much of the remaining distance, and the drop thence
to the ground would be easy. In another moment he
was outside the window, and, grasping the silk firmly
in his strong fingers, began his perilous descent.

<h2>VI</h2>
<h3>THE MOAT OF CAYLUS</h3>
</div>

<p>
The descent into the moat of Caylus was rather
a ticklish business, even with the aid of an improvised
rope, for the face of the cliff was, for the
most part, smooth, and afforded little in the way of
foothold, but Lagardere was a trained athlete and
a man of great physical strength, one that could use
his feet with skill for purchase against the face of
the rock, and he made his way dexterously to the end
of his tether. Even when he had got thus far, and
was swinging by his hands from the end of his taut
sash, he was a considerable distance from the ground.
But Lagardere let go with as light a heart as if he
were a new Curtius leaping into a new gulf; and, indeed,
if he had been of a mind to make the parallel,
he would have counted his stake as great as the
safety of Rome. Dropping like a plummet, he alighted
on his hands and knees on the ground. Quickly
he picked himself up, dusted the earth from his palms,
and, after carefully feeling himself all over to make
sure that he was none the worse, save for the jar
of his tumble, he looked about him cautiously. It
was late evening now, and the hot day knew no cooler
dusk.
</p>
<p>
As he looked up from the strange vault in which
he stood, the vault that was formed by the moat of
Caylus between the rock on which the castle rose
and the rock on which the Inn of the Seven Devils
was perched, he saw above him the late evening sky
painted with the strangest pageant. To the right
of the spot where the sun had declined the purple
melancholy of the heavens was broken by a blaze of
gold, such as might have flashed from the armor of
some celestial host marshalled and marching against
the Powers of Darkness. To the left, under lowered
eyelids of sable clouds, there ran a band of red fire
that seemed as if it must belt the earth with its fury,
a red fire that might have flamed from the mouth
of the very pit. Lagardere was not over-imaginative,
but the strangeness of the contrast, the fierce splendor
of the warring colors, touched the player&#8217;s heart beneath
the soldier&#8217;s hide. "The gold of heaven," he
murmured, and saluted the sky to the right. "The
rod of hell," he thought, and pointed towards the
left, where distant trees stared, black, angry outlines
against those waves of livid fire. Was not this contest
in the clouds a kind of allegory of the quarrel in
which he was now engaged, and was not his cause
very surely, in its righteousness, its justice, its honor,
gilded and invigorated by those noble rays to strive
against and overthrow the legionaries of evil?
</p>
<p>
Even as he thought such unfamiliar thoughts, the
pageant of opposing forces dimmed and dwindled.
The darkness was gathering swiftly, investing the
world with its legion of gloom; and in the shadow
of the great Castle of Caylus, rising like a rock itself
out of the solid rock behind Lagardere, the moat
was soon very dark indeed. There was little light in
the moonless sky; there came none from the castle,
which in its dim outline of towers and battlements
might have been the enchanted palace of some fairy
tale, so soundless, so lightless, so unpeopled did it
seem. There was a faint gleam discernible in the
windows of the Inn on the other side of the gorge
from which he had just succeeded in escaping.
</p>
<p>
Lagardere looked up at the Inn and laughed; Lagardere
looked up at the castle and smiled. What
was she like, he wondered, that beautiful Gabrielle
de Caylus, whom it had been his impudent ambition
to woo, and whom he now knew to be married to
Nevers, his appointed antagonist? He had come all
that way with the pleasant intention of killing Nevers,
but he felt more friendly towards his enemy since he
had learned of the plot against his life, and he wondered
who was the instigator of that plot, who was
the paymaster of the, as he believed, baffled assassins.
For in a sense he believed them to be baffled, and
this for two reasons. The first was that he heard
no sound of stealthy footsteps creeping across the
bridge. The second was that when he glanced up
at the Inn window he saw that the dim glow in the
distant window was suddenly occulted, and then
as suddenly became visible again. It was plain to
Lagardere that some one had entered the room and
had looked out of the window for an instant. Therefore
some one had already discovered his absence,
probably the maid of the Inn. No doubt she would
send word to the bravos, and it might very well
chance that the bravos would not think the odds
in their favor sufficiently good when they knew that
they had to deal with Henri de Lagardere as well as
with Louis de Nevers.
</p>
<p>
Lagardere whistled cheerfully the lilt of a drinking-song
as he reflected thus, for he considered himself
quite equal to handling the whole batch of rascallions
if only he had a wall of some kind to back him. He
was fondling the possibility that they had given up
the whole business in disgust at his interruption of
their purpose, when it suddenly stabbed his fancy
that they might ambush Nevers on his way. But
he dismissed that fear instantly. He hoped and believed
that if they knew he was free they would
give him the first chance to kill Nevers for them. In
any case, all that he could do was to wait patiently
where he was and see what the creeping minutes
brought.
</p>
<p>
The moat of Caylus did not appear to him to be,
under the existing conditions, by any means the
ideal field for a duel. In the darkness it seemed to
him to be more happily adapted for a game of blindman&#8217;s-buff.
There was a half-filled hay-cart in the
moat, and bundles of hay were scattered hither and
thither on the ground and littered the place confusingly.
Lagardere began to busy himself in clearing
some of this hay out of the way, so as to afford
an untroubled space for the coming combat. While
he was thus engaged he heard for the first time a
faint sound come from the direction of the castle.
It was the sound of a door being turned cautiously
upon its hinges. Crouching in the shadow of the
rock down which he had lately descended, Lagardere
looked round and saw dimly two forms emerge
like shadows from the very side of the castle. The
new-comers had come forth from a little postern
that gave onto the moat, to which they descended
by some narrow steps cut in the rock, and they now
walked a little way slowly into the darkness. Lagardere,
all watchfulness, could hear one of the shadows
say to the other, "This way, monseigneur," and the
word "monseigneur" made him wonder. Was he
going to be brought face to face with the Marquis of
Caylus, the old ogre whose grim tyranny had been
talked of even in Paris?
</p>
<p>
The shadow addressed as monseigneur answered,
"I see no one," and the voices of both the shadows
were unfamiliar to the listener. But the voice of the
shadow that was saluted as monseigneur sounded
like the voice of a young man.
</p>
<p>
The leading shadow seemed to be peering into
the darkness in front of him. "I told them to place
a sentinel," he said to his companion; and as he
spoke he caught sight of Lagardere, who must have
looked as shadowy to him as he looked to Lagardere,
and he pointed as he added: "Yes, there is some one
there, monseigneur."
</p>
<p>
"Who is it?" the second shadow questioned, and
again the voice sounded youthful to Lagardere&#8217;s
ears.
</p>
<p>
"It looks like Saldagno," said the first shadow;
and, coming a little farther forward, he called dubiously
into the gloom: "Is that you, Saldagno?"
</p>
<p>
Now, as Saldagno was the name of one of the
swordsmen who had met at the Inn in menace of
Nevers, Lagardere came to the swift conclusion that
the two shadows now haunting him had something
to do with that conspiracy, and that, if it were
possible, it would be as well to learn their purposes.
He was, therefore, quite prepared to be Saldagno
for the occasion, and it was with a well-affected
Lusitanian accent that he promptly answered, "Present,"
and came a little nearer to the strangers.
</p>
<p>
The first shadow spoke again, craning a long neck
into the darkness. "It is I, Monsieur Peyrolles.
Come here."
</p>
<p>
Lagardere advanced obediently, and the second
shadow, coming to the side of his companion, questioned
him. "Would you like to earn fifty pistoles?"
</p>
<p>
Although both the voices were strange to Lagardere,
the voice of this second shadow seemed to
denote a person of better breeding than his companion,
a person accustomed to command when the
other was accustomed to cajole. Also, it was decidedly
the voice of a young man. Whoever the
speaker might be, he certainly was not the crabbed
old Marquis de Caylus. Lagardere endeavored eagerly
but unsuccessfully to see the face of the speaker.
Night had by this time fallen completely. The moat
was as black as a wolf&#8217;s mouth, and the shadow
that was muffled in a cloak held a corner of it so
raised that it would have concealed his visage if the
gorge had been flooded with moonlight.
</p>
<p>
"Who would not?" Lagardere answered, with a
swagger which seemed to him appropriate to a light-hearted
assassin.
</p>
<p>
The shadow gave him commands. "When ten
o&#8217;clock strikes, tap at this window with your sword."
He pointed as he spoke to the wall of the castle,
and in that wall Lagardere, peering through the
obscurity, could faintly discern a window about a
man&#8217;s height from the moat. The speaker went on:
"A woman will open. Whisper very low, &#8217;I am here.&#8217;"
</p>
<p>
Involuntarily Lagardere echoed the last words, "I
am here," and added, "The motto of Nevers."
</p>
<p>
There was annoyance in the well-bred voice as it
questioned, sharply: "What do you know of Nevers?"
</p>
<p>
Peyrolles respectfully answered for the sham
Saldagno: "Monseigneur, they all know whom they
are to meet. How they know I cannot tell, but they
do know. But they are to be trusted."
</p>
<p>
The shadow shrugged his shoulders and resumed
his instructions: "The woman will hand you a
child, a baby a few months old. Take it at once to
the Inn." He paused for a moment and then said,
slowly: "I trust you are not tender-hearted."
</p>
<p>
Lagardere protested with voice and gesture.
"You pain me," he declared.
</p>
<p>
Apparently satisfied, the shadow went on: "If
the girl should die in your arms, no one will blame
you, and your fifty pistoles will be a hundred. &#8217;Tis
but a quick nip of finger and thumb on an infant&#8217;s
neck. Do you understand?"
</p>
<p>
"What I do not understand," retorted Lagardere,
"is why you do not do the job yourself and save your
money."
</p>
<p>
It was now Peyrolles&#8217;s turn to be annoyed. "Rascal!"
he exclaimed, angrily. But the man he called
monseigneur restrained him.
</p>
<p>
"Calm, Peyrolles, calm! For the very good reason,
inquisitive gentleman, that the lady in question
would know my voice or the voice of my friend here,
and as I do not wish her to think that I have anything
to do with to-night&#8217;s work&mdash;"
</p>
<p>
Lagardere interrupted, bluffly: "Say no more.
I&#8217;m your man."
</p>
<p>
Even as he spoke the plaintive sound of a horn
was heard far away in the distance. Peyrolles
spoke: "The first signal. The shepherds have been
told to watch and warn at the wood-ends and the
by-path and the causeway to the bridge. Nevers
has entered the forest."
</p>
<p>
The noble shadow gave a little laugh. "He is
riding to his death, the fool amorist. Come."
</p>
<p>
Then the two shadows flitted away in the darkness
as nebulously as they had come, and the castle
swallowed them up, and Lagardere was alone again
in the moat among the bundles of hay.
</p>
<p>
"May the devil fly away with you for a pair of
knaves!" he said beneath his breath, apostrophizing
the vanished shadows. "But I&#8217;ll save the child
and Nevers in spite of you." For in those moments
of horrid colloquy all his purpose had been transmuted.
These unknown plotters of murder had
confirmed him in his alliance to the man he had
come to slay. So long as Nevers was in peril from
these strange enemies, so long Lagardere would be
his friend, free, of course, to rekindle his promise
later. But now even Nevers&#8217;s life was not of the
first importance. There was a child threatened, a
child to be saved. Who were these devils, these
Herods, that sought to slay a baby?
</p>
<p>
Even as he asked himself this question he could
hear through the clear air the striking of a clock in
the distant village. He counted the strokes from
one to ten. This was the time that had been fixed
by the master shadow. Lagardere made his way carefully
across the moat till he stood beneath the designated
window. He drew his sword and tapped with
the blade thrice against the pane. Then he sheathed
his sword and waited upon events.
</p>

<h2>VII</h2>
<h3>BROTHERS-IN-ARMS</h3>
</div>

<p>
He had not long to wait. In a few moments the
window above him turned softly on its hinges,
and a head appeared in the open space. The chamber
from which the window opened was unilluminated,
and the light in the moat was so dim that Lagardere
could only perceive the vague outline of a woman&#8217;s
head and shoulders leaning forward into the darkness.
Even in that moment of tension he felt himself
stirred by a sharp regret that he should not be
able to judge for himself as to the beauty of the lady
whom the world called Gabrielle de Caylus, but whom
he knew to be the Duchess de Nevers. A very low,
sweet voice called to him through the darkness, speaking
the Christian name of Nevers.
</p>
<p>
"Louis!" the woman said, and Lagardere immediately
answered, "I am here." He spoke very low,
that his voice might not be recognized, and because
he had the mimic&#8217;s trick he made his voice as like
as he could to the voice of Nevers.
</p>
<p>
Evidently his voice was not recognized, evidently
the lady took him for her lord, for she immediately
went on speaking very low and clear, her words
falling rapidly from above on the ears of the waiting
Lagardere.
</p>
<p>
"Do not speak, Louis," she said; "do not linger.
I am watched; I fear danger. Take our dear Gabrielle."
</p>
<p>
As she spoke she leaned her body a little farther
forward into the night and extended her arms towards
her hearer.
</p>
<p>
Lagardere tingled with a sudden thrill as he realized
that this beautiful woman was nearer to him, that
she was seeking him, that she believed him to be her
lover. And he realized with a pang that he, impudent
in his libertinism, had entertained with a light
heart the light hope in some audacious way to take
by storm the love of this unknown woman. It had
seemed, in Paris, an insolently boyishly possible, plausible
adventure; but now, in his new knowledge and
in this distant, lonely place, his enterprise, that, after
all, was little more than an impish vision, seemed
no other than a tragi-comical impertinence. All
that he had known of Gabrielle de Caylus was that
she was reported fair, and that she was loved by his
enemy. All that he knew of her now was that she
was his enemy&#8217;s wife, that she had a gracious voice,
and that she loved his enemy very dearly; yet this
was enough for Lagardere, this, and to know that the
woman was all unconsciously trusting to his honor,
to his courage, to his truth. And it was with an unfamiliar
exaltation of the spirit that Lagardere swore
to himself that the unwitting confidence of Gabrielle
de Caylus should not be misplaced, and that all his
hand, his heart, his sword could do for her service
should cheerfully and faithfully be done.
</p>
<p>
Lagardere could see that she was holding something
in the nature of a bundle in her out-stretched
arms. This was the child, no doubt, of whom the
masked shadow had spoken. Lagardere took the
bundle cautiously in his hands and lowered it to a
secure resting-place in his left arm. Then the Duchess
de Nevers spoke again, and he saw that she was
holding another and smaller object in her hand.
</p>
<p>
"This packet," she said, "contains the papers recording
our marriage, torn from the register of the
chapel. I feared they would be destroyed if I did
not save them."
</p>
<p>
As she spoke she put the packet into Lagardere&#8217;s
extended right hand, and as his fingers closed upon
it the horn that he had heard before was wound again
in the distance, but this time it seemed to his keen
ears that the sound was nearer than before.
</p>
<p>
The woman in the window gave a shiver. "There
is much to say," she sighed, "but no time to say it
now. That may be a signal. Go, go, Louis. I love
you."
</p>
<p>
In another moment her head was drawn back into
the darkness of the apartment, the window closed, and
the old castle was as silent and obscure as before.
If it were not for the bundle in his left arm and the
packet in his right hand, Lagardere might well have
been tempted to believe that the whole episode was
no more than the fancy of a dream. He thrust the
packet into his breast, and then moved slowly towards
the centre of the moat, tenderly cradling his
precious charge. Peering closely down at the bundle,
he could dimly discern what seemed to be a
baby face among the encircling folds of silk which
wrapped the child. It was sleeping soundly; the
transition from its mother&#8217;s arms to the arms of the
soldier of fortune had not wakened it, and now, as
Lagardere gently rocked it in his arms, it continued
to sleep.
</p>
<p>
The whimsicality of the adventure began to tickle
Lagardere&#8217;s fancy. He seemed to be destined to
play many parts that night. A few minutes back
he had masqueraded as a bravo to deceive the mysterious
shadows. Then he had pretended to be a
husband to deceive the Duchess de Nevers. Now
he imitated a nurse in order that Nevers&#8217;s child might
sleep soundly. He looked again at the quiet morsel
of humanity, and his heart was stirred with strange
desires and melancholy imaginings. Raising his hand
to his hat, he uncovered solemnly and made the baby
a sweeping salute.
</p>
<p>
"Mademoiselle de Nevers," he whispered, "your
loyal servant salutes you! Sleep in peace, pretty
sweetheart."
</p>
<p>
Then he began to sing softly beneath his breath the
burden of an old French lullaby which he remembered
from his childhood days, with its burden of
"Do, do, l&#8217;enfant do, l&#8217;enfant dormira tantôt," and
as he sang the horn again sounded the same dreary,
prolonged note as before, but now more clearly, and
therefore plainly nearer.
</p>
<p>
"That must be the last signal," Lagardere thought,
and on the moment he heard the sound of footsteps
on the bridge, and out of the darkness beyond a
man slowly descended into the darkness of the moat.
In another instant Lagardere heard the well-known
voice of Nevers calling out: "Halloo! Is any one
here?"
</p>
<p>
Lagardere advanced to meet his appointed enemy.
"This way, duke!" he cried. Then he added, reprovingly:
"You would have been wiser to carry a
lantern."
</p>
<p>
Nevers moved swiftly towards him along the kind
of path that Lagardere had made in the bundle of
hay, and as he came he spoke, and his tone was
menacing and imperious. "Let me feel your blade.
I can kill in the dark."
</p>
<p>
Lagardere answered him, ironically: "Gifted gentleman!
But I want a talk first."
</p>
<p>
He had scarcely finished when a flash like lightning
stabbed the darkness and came very near to
stabbing him. It was the sword of Nevers, who
was thrusting wildly before him into the gloom, while
he cried: "Not a word! You have insulted a woman!"
</p>
<p>
Lagardere beat a rapid retreat for a few paces,
and called to him: "I apologize humbly, abjectly. I
kneel for forgiveness."
</p>
<p>
Nevers&#8217;s only answer was to follow up and thrust
rapidly at Lagardere&#8217;s retreating figure, while he
cried, fiercely: "Too late."
</p>
<p>
There was nothing for Lagardere to do but to
defend himself in order to gain time with this
passionate madman. Therefore, Lagardere drew his
sword and parried the attack which Nevers was now
making at close quarters. It was so dark in the
moat that the two antagonists could scarcely see each
other, and even the brightness of the blades was with
difficulty distinguished. In a voice that was at once
anxious and mocking, Lagardere cried to the duke:
"Unnatural parent, do you wish to kill your child?"
</p>
<p>
The last word stopped Nevers like a blow. He
lowered his sword and spoke wonderingly: "My child!
What do you mean?"
</p>
<p>
Lagardere answered him, gravely: "At this moment
Mademoiselle de Nevers is nestled in my arms."
</p>
<p>
Nevers echoed him, astonished: "My daughter,
in your arms?"
</p>
<p>
Lagardere came quite close to the duke and showed
him the bundle cradled in his elbow. "See for yourself;
but step gently, for the young lady&#8217;s sleep must
be respected."
</p>
<p>
Nevers gave a gasp of surprise. "What has happened?"
</p>
<p>
Lagardere answered him, slowly: "Madame de
Nevers gave this little lady to me just now from
yonder window, taking me for you. There is a plot
to kill the child, to kill you."
</p>
<p>
Nevers gave a groan. "This is the hate of the
Marquis de Caylus."
</p>
<p>
"I don&#8217;t know who is doing the job," Lagardere
answered, "but what I do know is that the night
is alive with assassins. I think I have got rid of
some of them, but there may be others, wherefore
prudence advises us to be off."
</p>
<p>
He could see Nevers stiffen himself in the darkness
as he answered, proudly: "A Nevers fly?"
</p>
<p>
Lagardere shrugged his shoulders. "Even I have
no passion for flight, but with a sweet young lady to
defend&mdash;"
</p>
<p>
Nevers seemed to accept his correction. "You are
right. Forgive me. Let us go."
</p>
<p>
The two men turned to leave the moat, but as they
did so they were stopped by the sound of fresh footsteps
on the bridge, and in another instant Nevers&#8217;s
page had descended the steps and ran to join them.
</p>
<p>
"My lord!" he cried to the duke as soon as he
reached the pair&mdash;"my lord, my lord, you are surrounded!"
</p>
<p>
Nevers gave an angry cry: "Too late!"
</p>
<p>
Lagardere answered him with a laugh. "Nonsense!
There are but nine rascals."
</p>
<p>
But the laugh died away upon his lips when the
page hurriedly interrupted: "Twenty at least."
</p>
<p>
Lagardere was staggered but emphatic. "Nine,
duke, nine. I saw them, counted them, know them."
</p>
<p>
The page was equally emphatic. "They have got
help since you came. There are smugglers hereabouts,
and they have recruited their ranks from
them."
</p>
<p>
Lagardere grunted. "Ungentlemanly," he protested,
and then addressed Nevers: "Well, duke,
we can manage ten apiece easily." He turned to
the boy and gave him some quick instructions.
"Creep through the wood behind the castle to the
highway. Run like the devil to the cross-roads,
where my men wait. Tell them Lagardere is in
danger. They may be here in a quarter of an hour."
</p>
<p>
The boy answered him, decisively: "They shall
be."
</p>
<p>
Lagardere patted him on the back. "Good lad,"
he said, and the boy darted from his side and disappeared
into the darkness.
</p>
<p>
Lagardere turned to the duke. "There is no
chance of escaping now without a scuffle," he said;
"we must fight it out as well as we can. You and
I, duke, ought not to think it a great matter to
handle ten rascals apiece in this fighting-place, if
only we intrench ourselves properly."
</p>
<p>
As he spoke he laid his precious bundle reverently
in the hay-cart, where it seemed to sleep as peacefully
as if it were in its native cradle, and began piling up
the great masses of the bundles of hay in front of
him to form a kind of rampart.
</p>
<p>
Nevers looked at him in astonishment. "Do you
stand by me?"
</p>
<p>
Lagardere answered him cheerfully. "I came here
to fight with you. I stay here to fight for you. I
must fight somebody. I lose by the change, for it is
a greater honor to fight Monsieur de Nevers than
a battalion of bravos, but there is no help for it."
</p>
<p>
There was a little silence, and then Nevers said,
slowly: "You are a splendid gentleman."
</p>
<p>
"There is nothing to make a fuss about," Lagardere
said, lightly. "I am this little lady&#8217;s soldier. I
came here in a cutthroat humor enough, but since
I dandled her daintiness in my arms I&#8217;ve taken a fine
liking for her father."
</p>
<p>
Nevers reached out his hand to Lagardere. "Henceforward
we are comrades&mdash;brothers."
</p>
<p>
Lagardere clasped the extended hand. "Heart
and hand, for life and death, brother."
</p>

<h3>THE FIGHT IN THE MOAT</h3>
</div>

<p>
As they stood there, hand clasped in hand, exchanging
the dateless pledge of brotherhood,
they heard the sound of many feet coming cautiously
along the road to the bridge. The practised assassins
walked catfoot, but there were others that
shuffled in their care to go warily.
</p>
<p>
Nevers said, quietly: "Here come the swords."
</p>
<p>
Lagardere gave a jolly laugh. "Now for a glorious
scrimmage!" he said, and made his sword sing in the
air.
</p>
<p>
As he spoke the words, shade after shade began to
descend the steps from the bridge and to advance
cautiously into the moat. Lagardere counted them
as they came: one, two, three, four, five, six, seven,
eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen,
fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, nineteen, twenty.
Even in the darkness he thought he could recognize
certain figures: the twisted form of the hunchback,
the burly body of Cocardasse, the gaunt figure of
the Norman, the barrel bulk of Staupitz. This barrel
bulk came to the front of the shadows huddled
together at the base of the hill, and spoke with the
thick, Teutonic voice that Lagardere had heard so
short a time before. "There they are," Staupitz
said, and Lagardere could see a gleam in the night as
the German pointed to where the two newly bound
comrades stood together.
</p>
<p>
An instant answer came with the defiant cry of
Nevers, "I am here!" which was immediately echoed
by Lagardere. "I am here!" he shouted; and then
added for himself: "Lagardere! Lagardere!"
</p>
<p>
Among the bravos a momentary note of comedy
intruded upon the intended tragedy, as is often the
way when humanity foregathers on sinister business.
Cocardasse plucked Passepoil by the sleeve and drew
him a little away from their fellow-ruffians. "We
cannot fight against the Little Parisian," he whispered
into the Norman&#8217;s ear. "We will look on,
comrade." Passepoil nodded approval, but spoke
no word. For the rest of that red adventure into
the placid blackness of the night those two stood
apart in the shadow, with their arms folded and
their swords in their sheaths, sombrely watching the
seven men that were their friends assailing the one
man they loved. Such honor as they had forbade
them to change sides and fight for the Little Parisian.
They had been paid to range with the assailants
of Nevers. But no payment could possibly prevail
on them to attack Lagardere. So, according to
their consciences, they split the difference and held
aloof. Their abstention was not noticed by their
fellows in the excitement of the time.
</p>
<p>
Numerous as they were, the bravos and their new
recruits seemed unwilling to advance against two such
famous swordsmen. Lagardere taunted their apathy:
</p>
<p>
"Come, you crows, the eagles wait for you." He
felt that the words had a fine theatrical ring, and
he enjoyed them as he flung them forth.
</p>
<p>
Nevers cried his cry, "I am here!" and Lagardere
repeated it, "I am here!" He was longing to come
to blows with the bandits, and to show them what
two men could do against their multitude. His
sword quivered like a snake in its eagerness to feel
blades against its blade.
</p>
<p>
The barrel bulk of Staupitz spoke again addressing
his little army. "Do you fear two men?" he asked.
"Forward!"
</p>
<p>
On the word the eighteen men charged, the original
seven leading; the eleven recruits, less whole-hearted
in the business, came less alertly in the rear. The
charge of the assassins was abruptly arrested by
Lagardere&#8217;s bulwark, and over that bulwark the
swords of the two defenders flashed and leaped, and
before every thrust a man went down. It seemed an
age of battle, it seemed an instant of battle. Then
the baffled assassins recoiled, leaving two of the
smugglers for dead, while Saldagno and Faenza were
both badly wounded, and cursing hideously in Portuguese
and Italian.
</p>
<p>
Behind the intrenchments, Lagardere chuckled as
he heard. He turned to Nevers. "Are you wounded?"
he asked, anxiously.
</p>
<p>
And Nevers answered, quietly: "A scratch on the
forehead."
</p>
<p>
As he saw Nevers lift his hand for a moment to
the space between his eyes, Lagardere groaned to himself,
"My damned fencing-lesson," and mentally promised
to make his enemies pay for their readiness to
learn. He had not long to wait for an opportunity.
</p>
<p>
The discomfited bravos were rapidly gathering together
for a fresh attack. This time their leading
spirit was no longer Staupitz, disagreeably conscious
of the difficulties of the enterprise, but the hunchback
Æsop, who seemed to burn with a passion for
slaughter. Lagardere likened him in his mind to
some ungainly, obscene bird of prey, as he loomed
out of the mirk waving his gaunt arms and shrieking
in his rage and hate. "Kill them! kill them!" he
screamed, as he rushed across the intervening space,
and the bravos, heartened by his frenzy of fight,
streamed after him, flinging themselves desperately
against the piled-up hay, only to meet again the irresistible
weapons of the friends, and again to recoil
before them. Nevers held his own on one side;
Lagardere held his own on the other. Nevers delivered
his thrust at Æsop, and for the second time
that day the hunchback felt the prick of steel between
his eyes and saved himself by springing backward,
his blood&#8217;s fire suddenly turned to ice. Lagardere&#8217;s
sword was like a living fire. "Look out,
Staupitz! Take that, Pepe!" he cried, and wounded
both men. Then, while the German and the Spaniard
fell back swearing, he turned joyously to Nevers,
for his quick ear caught the sound of galloping on
the distant highway.
</p>
<p>
"Good cheer, brother! I hear horses. My men
are coming. Lagardere! Lagardere!"
</p>
<p>
Nevers responded joyously, "I am here! Victory!"
</p>
<p>
By this time the ground was strewn with the dead
and wounded of their assailants, and, save for the
slight scratch on Nevers&#8217;s forehead, the defenders
were unhurt. The galloping of horses was now distinctly
heard, and the sound was as displeasing to the
bravos as it was delightful to Lagardere.
</p>
<p>
Delightful, indeed, for the sake of his companion,
whom he was so hot to save. Otherwise, Lagardere,
so far as he had clearness enough to think coherently
at all, thought that he had never lived, had never
hoped to live, through moments so delightful. To be
in the thick of such a brawl, to be fighting side by
side with the best swordsman in all France against
what might well be considered overwhelming odds,
and to be working havoc and disaster among his
antagonists, stirred Lagardere&#8217;s blood more blithely
than ripe wine. He had fought good fights before
now, but never such a fight as this, in the black and
dark night, with the dim air thick with hostile swords,
and the night wind singing songs of battle in his
ears. To live like this was to be very much alive;
this had a zest denied to any calmly planned duello;
this had a poetry fiercer and finer than the shock of
action in the daylit lanes of war.
</p>
<p>
He called merrily to the bravos to renew their
assault, but the bravos hung back discouraged;
even the murder-zeal of Æsop had flagged. Then,
in an instant, the attacked became the attackers,
on the impulse of Nevers. Shouting anew the motto
of his house, "I am here!" he leaped lightly over the
rampart of hay, soliciting the swords of his foemen.
Lagardere followed his example in an instant, and
the pair now carried the war into the enemies&#8217; country,
charging the staggered assassins, who scattered
before them. Lagardere drove some half a dozen
of the rogues, including Staupitz and the discomfited
Æsop, towards the bridge. Nevers, nearer to
the castle, struck down in quick succession two of
the ruffians that were rash enough to stand their
ground, and stood for the moment alone and unassailed,
the master of his part of the field.
</p>
<p>
Noiselessly behind him the little postern of Caylus
opened. Noiselessly two shadows emerged, both
masked and both holding drawn swords. Though it
was still all blackness under the walls of the castle,
there was now a little light in the sky, where a pale
moon swam like a golden ship through wave after
wave of engulfing cloud. The pair paused for a moment,
as if to make sure that indeed their auxiliaries
were being routed. Then the foremost shadow glided
quietly close to Nevers, where he stood flushed with
victory.
</p>
<p>
"I am here!" Nevers cried, exulting, as he waved his
conquering sword and looked in vain for an antagonist.
</p>
<p>
"I am here!" repeated the shadow behind him,
mockingly, and thrust his weapon deep into the
victor&#8217;s side. Nevers reeled before the suddenness
and sureness of the stroke, and fell on his knees to
the ground with a great cry that startled Lagardere
and stayed him in his triumph. Nevers, striving to
rise, turned his face against his treacherous enemy,
and seemed to recognize the shadow in spite of its
masked visage.
</p>
<p>
"You!" he gasped&mdash;"you, for whom I would have
given my life!"
</p>
<p>
"Well, I take it," the shadow whispered, grimly,
and stabbed him again. Nevers fell in a huddle to
the earth, but he raised his dying breath in a cry.
</p>
<p>
"Help, Lagardere! help! Save the child! Avenge
me!"
</p>
<p>
Then he died. Though the assassin stabbed again,
he only stabbed a corpse. Lagardere, who was brooming
his foes before him as a gardener brooms autumnal
leaves from grass, had been arrested in his course by
the first cry of the wounded Nevers. While he paused,
his antagonists, rallying a little and heartened by
their numbers, made ready for a fresh attack. Then,
swiftly, came Nevers&#8217;s last wild call for help, and
Lagardere, with a great fear and a great fury in his
heart, turned from the steps leading to the bridge
and made to join his comrade. But the clustering
swordsmen heard that cry, too, and found new courage
in the sound. It meant that one of the demi-gods
with whom, as it seemed, they were warring,
was now no more than common clay, and that there
was good hope of ending the other. They came together;
they came upon Lagardere; they strove to
stay him in his way. They might as well have tried
to stay a hurricane. Lagardere beat them back, cut
them down, and swept through their reeling line to
the spot where Nevers was lying.
</p>
<p>
"I am here!" he shouted, and faced the masked
shadow. "Murderer, you hide your face, but you
shall bear my mark, that I may know you when we
meet again."
</p>
<p>
The slayer of Nevers had stood on guard by the
side of his victim when Lagardere came towards
him. By his side the masked companion extended
a cautious blade. In one wild second Lagardere
beat down the slayer&#8217;s sword and wounded the
unknown man deeply on the wrist. The assassin&#8217;s
sword fell from his hand, and the assassin, with a
cry of rage, retreated into the darkness. Lagardere
had only time to brand the traitor; he had not
the time to kill him. Looking swiftly about him, he
saw that his vengeance must be patient if he were
to save his skin from that shambles. The sword of
the satellite defended the master; other swords
began to gleam anew. From all the quarters of
that field of fight the bravos were gathering again,
all there were left of them, and Lagardere was now
alone. With the activity of the skilled acrobat he
leaped backward to the cart, and, while he still
faced his enemies and while his terrible sword glittered
in ceaseless movement, he snatched the child
from the sheltering hay with his left hand, and,
turning, began to run at his full speed towards the
bridge. There were bravos in his path that thought
to stay him, but they gave way before the headlong
fury of his rush as if they believed him to be irresistible,
and he reached the steps in safety.
</p>
<p>
Once there he turned again and raised his sword
in triumph, while he cried, fiercely: "Nevers is dead!
Long live Nevers!"
</p>
<p>
By now the galloping of horses sounded loud as
immediate thunder, and even as Lagardere spoke
a number of shadowy horsemen had occupied the
bridge behind him, and those in the moat could see
above them the glint of levelled muskets. The
servant shadow held the postern open with a trembling
hand to harbor the survivors of the strife. But
the man that had killed Nevers, the man that Lagardere
had branded, had still a hate to satisfy.
</p>
<p>
"A thousand crowns," he cried, "to the man who
gets the child!"
</p>
<p>
Not a man of all the baffled assassins answered
to that challenge. Standing upon the steps of the
bridge, Lagardere caught it up.
</p>
<p>
"Seek her behind my sword, assassin! You wear
my mark, and I will find you out! You shall all
suffer! After the lackeys, the master! Sooner or
later Lagardere will come to you!"

<h2>IX</h2>
<h3>THE SCYTHE OF TIME</h3>
</div>

<p>
The years came and the years went, as had been
their way since the fall of Troy and earlier. To
the philosophic eye, surveying existence with the supreme
wisdom of the initiate into mysteries, things
changed but little through eons on the surface of
the world, where men loved and hated, bred and
slew, triumphed and failed, lorded and cringed as
had been the way since the beginning, when the
cave man that handled the heavier knuckle-bone
ruled the roost. But to the unphilosophic eye of
the majority of mankind things seemed to change
greatly in a very little while; and it seemed, therefore,
to the superficial, that many things had happened
in France and in Paris during the seventeen
years that had elapsed since the fight in the moat
of Caylus.
</p>
<p>
To begin with, the great cardinal, the Red Man,
the master of France, had dipped from his dusk to
his setting, and was inurned, with much pomp and
solemnity, as a great prince of the church should be,
and the planet wheeled on its indifferent way, though
Armand du Plessis, Cardinal de Richelieu, was no
more. His Gracious Majesty Louis the Thirteenth,
self-named Louis the Just, found himself, for the
first time in his futile career, his own master, and
did not know quite what to make of the privilege.
He mourned the deceased statesman with one eye,
as it were, while he ogled his belated goddess of freedom
with the other. It might well be that she had
paid too tardy a visit, but at least he would essay to
trifle with her charms.
</p>
<p>
Many things had happened to the kingdom over
which, for the first time, his Majesty the King held
undivided authority since the night of Caylus fight.
For one thing, by the cardinal&#8217;s order, all the fortified
castles in France had been dismantled, and
many of them reduced to ruins, owl-haunted, lizard-haunted,
ivy-curtained. This decree did not especially
affect Caylus, which had long ceased to be a possible
menace to the state, and, after the death of the grim
old marquis, was rapidly falling into decay on its
own account without aid from the ministers of Richelieu&#8217;s
will. For another thing, two very well-esteemed
gentlemen of his Majesty&#8217;s Musketeers, having been
provoked by two other very well-esteemed gentlemen
of his Eminence&#8217;s Musketeers, had responded
to the challenge with the habitual alacrity of that
distinguished body, and had vindicated its superiority
in swordcraft by despatching their antagonists.
After this victory the gentlemen of the Musketeers,
remembering the rigor of the cardinal&#8217;s antipathy
to duelling, made a vain effort to put some distance
between them and the king&#8217;s justice. They were
arrested in their flight, brought back to Paris, and
perished miserably on the scaffold by the pointless
sword of the executioner. Each of these events
proved in its degree that Monsieur de Richelieu had
very little respect for tradition, and that if he disliked
an institution, no matter how time-hallowed and
admired by gentlemen, he did away with it in the
most uncompromising and arbitrary manner. There
were many other doings during the days of the cardinal&#8217;s
glory that are of no account in this chronicle,
though they were vastly of importance to the
people of France. But many things had happened
that are of moment to this chronicle, and these,
therefore, shall be set down as briefly as may be.
</p>
<p>
News did not travel, when the seventeenth century
was still young, from one end of the kingdom
to the other with any desperate rapidity. Even
when the posts rode at a hand gallop, the long leagues
took their long time to cover, and, after all, of most
of the news that came to the capital from abroad
and afar it was generally safe to disbelieve a full
half, to discredit the third quarter, and to be justifiably
sceptical as to the remaining portion. But,
credible or incredible, all news is blown to Paris, as
all roads lead to Rome, and in the fulness of time it
got to be known in Paris that the Duke Louis de
Nevers, the young, the beautiful, the brilliant, had
come to his death in an extraordinary and horrible
manner hard by the Spanish frontier, having been,
as it seemed, deliberately butchered by a party of
assassins employed, so it was said, by his father-in-law,
the old Count of Caylus.
</p>
<p>
It was not difficult for the well-informed in Paris
to credit the ignoble rumor. The old feud between
the house of Caylus, on the one hand, and the house
of Nevers on the other, was familiar to those who
made it their business to be familiar with the movements
of high persons in high places; and when on
the top of this inherited feud you had the secret
marriage between the son of the house of Nevers and
the daughter of the house of Caylus, there was every
reason, at least, to believe in a bloody end to the
business. There was, however, no jot of definite
proof against the marquis. Nevers&#8217;s dead body was
found, indeed, in the neighborhood of the castle, with
three sword wounds on it, one inflicted from the
back and two from the front, but who inflicted or
caused to be inflicted those wounds it was impossible
to assert with knowledge, though it was easy enough
to hazard a conjecture.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, Louis de Nevers was dead. It was amazing
news enough for Paris, but there was more amazing
news to follow. To begin with, Louis de Nevers&#8217;s
young wife was now formally recognized even by the
old marquis as Louis de Nevers&#8217;s young widow. It
was true that there was no documentary evidence
of the marriage, but Prince Louis de Gonzague, who
happened to be a guest of the Marquis de Caylus at
the time of the murder, and who seemed little less
than inconsolable for the death of his friend, came
forward in the handsomest, gallantest fashion to give
his evidence. He told how he and his faithful henchman
Peyrolles had been the witnesses of the secret
wedding. He succeeded in placating the wrath of
the Marquis of Caylus. He succeeded in obtaining
the sanction of the king, and, which was more important,
the sanction of the cardinal, to the recognition
of the marriage of Mademoiselle de Caylus
with the late Duke Louis de Nevers. All this was
thrilling news enough, but news more thrilling was
to follow. The newly recognized Duchess of Nevers
soon, to the astonishment and, at first, the blank
incredulity of all hearers, took to herself a third
name, and became Madame la Princesse de Gonzague.
There was soon no doubt about it. She had consented
to marry, and had married, Prince Louis de
Gonzague, who, as all the world knew, had been the
closest friend of the dead Louis of Nevers with one
exception, and that was Louis of Bourbon, that was
King of France. People who talked of such things
said, and in this they were generally inspired in
some way, directly or indirectly, by friends of Prince
Louis de Gonzague, that the Duke de Nevers had
been murdered by an exiled captain of Light-Horse,
who was little else than a professional bully, and
who for some purpose or purposes of his own had,
at the same time, succeeded in stealing the duke&#8217;s
infant daughter. What the reasons might be for this
mysterious act of kidnapping they either were not
able or did not choose always to explain. It was an
undoubted fact that the late duke&#8217;s daughter had
disappeared, for the grief of the whilom Duchess de
Nevers and present Princess de Gonzague was excessive
for the loss of her child, and the efforts she made
and the money she spent in the hope of finding some
trace of her daughter were as useless as they were
unavailing. It was also certain that on or about the
time of the late duke&#8217;s death a certain captain of
Light-Horse, whose name some believed to be Henri
de Lagardere, had fled in hot haste from Paris to
save his audacious head from the outraged justice
of the king for fighting a duel with a certain truculent
Baron de Brissac and incontinently killing his
man.
</p>
<p>
What connection there might be between these
two events those that busied themselves in the matter
left to the imagination and intelligence of their
hearers, but after awhile few continued to busy themselves
in the matter at all. Nevers was dead and
forgotten. The fact that Nevers&#8217;s daughter had been
stolen was soon forgotten likewise by all save the
man and the woman whom it most immediately concerned.
Few troubled themselves to remember that
the Princess de Gonzague had been for a brief season
the Duchess de Nevers, and if Louis de Gonzague,
whenever the tragic episode was spoken of, expressed
the deepest regret for his lost heart&#8217;s brother and the
fiercest desire for vengeance upon his murderer or
murderers, the occasions on which the tragic episode was
referred to grew less year by year. Louis de Gonzague
flourished; Louis de Gonzague lived in Paris in great
state; Louis de Gonzague was the intimate, almost
the bosom friend, of the king; for Louis of Bourbon,
having lost one of the two Louis whom he loved,
seemed to have a double portion of affection to bestow
upon the survivor. If Louis de Gonzague did
not himself forget any of the events connected with
a certain night in the moat of Caylus; if he kept
emissaries employed in researches in Spain, emissaries
whose numbers dwindled dismally and mysteriously
enough in the course of those researches, he spoke of
his recollections to no one, save perhaps occasionally
to that distinguished individual, Monsieur Peyrolles,
who shared his master&#8217;s confidences as he shared his
master&#8217;s rise in fortunes. For Monsieur Peyrolles
knew as well as his master all about that night at
Caylus seventeen years before, and could, if he chose&mdash;but
he never did choose&mdash;have told exactly how
the Duke de Nevers came to his death, and how the
child of Nevers disappeared, and how it was that the
battered survivors of a little army of bravos had
been overawed by the muskets of a company of Free
Companions. He could have told how seven gentlemen
that were named Staupitz, Faenza, Saldagno,
Pepe, Pinto, Joel, and Æsop had been sent to dwell
and travel in Spain at the free charges of Prince
Louis de Gonzague, with the sole purpose of finding
a man and a child who so far had not been found,
though it was now seventeen years since the hounds
had been sent a-hunting.
</p>
<p>
But though a year may seem long in running, it
runs to its end, and seventeen years, as any school-boy
will prove to you, take only seventeen times the
length of one year to wheel into chaos. So these seventeen
years had been and had ceased to be, and it
was again summer-time, when many people travelled
from many parts of the world for the pleasure of
visiting Paris, and some of those travellers happened
to come from Spain.

<h3>A VILLAGE FAIR</h3>
</div>

<p>
It was a custom of old standing in the little village
of Neuilly to hold a fair every year in the full
flush of the spring. The custom of this fair went
back for ages; antiquarians declared that they could
find traces of it so far off as the reign of the good
King Dagobert of the yellow hair, who had, as immortal
song has consecrated, a trifling difficulty with his
smallclothes; at least, it was certain that it dated
from a very long time, and that year by year it had
grown in importance with the people who go to fairs
for the purposes of business, and in popularity with
the people who go to fairs for the purposes of pleasure.
Hither came half the tumblers, rope-walkers, contortionists,
balancers, bear-leaders, puppet-players,
wrestlers, strong men, fat women, bearded ladies,
living skeletons, horrible deformities, lion-tamers,
quack doctors, mountebanks, and jugglers who patrolled
Europe in those days, and earned a precarious
living and enjoyed the sweets of a vagabond freedom
in the plying of their varied trades.
</p>
<p>
At one time the fair of Neuilly had attracted only
the humbler folk from Paris to taste of its wares,
but as it had gradually grown in importance, so, accordingly,
it had increased the number of its clients.
First, the humbler burgesses came with their wives
to gape and stare at the marvels it displayed; then
their example was followed by the wealthier of their
kind, and fur and velvet moved freely among the
rabble of the fair. Now, in the year with which we
deal, it had been for some little time the fashion for
gentlefolk to drift in merry parties to Neuilly and
enjoy the fun of the fair as frankly as any sober burgess
or loose-tongued clerk. This year, however, a
greater honor still was in store for the fair and its fellowships
of vagrant playmakers. It was known to a
few, who were privileged to share the secret, and
also privileged to share the enjoyment with which
that secret was concerned, that his Sovereign Majesty
Louis of Bourbon, thirteenth of his name of the kings
of France, intended to visit incognito the fair at
Neuilly. He was to go thither accompanied by a few
of the choicest spirits of his court, the most excellent
of the rakes and libertines who had been received into
the intimacy of the king&#8217;s newly found liberty, and
those same rakes and libertines felt highly flattered
at being chosen by his highness for his companions
in an enterprise which at least was something out of
the beaten track of the rather humdrum amusements
of the Louvre. Why the king particularly wanted to
visit the fair of Neuilly on that particular day of that
particular spring-time, none of those that were in the
secret of the adventure professed to know or even
were curious to inquire. It was enough for them
that the king, in spite of his ill-health, looked now
with a favorable eye upon frivolity, and that a sport
was toward with which their palates for pleasure were
not already jaded, and they were as gleeful as children
at the prospect of the coming fun.
</p>
<p>
Neuilly knew nothing of the honor that was awaiting
it. Neuilly was busy with its booths and its
trestles and its platforms and its roped-in, canvas-walled
circuses, and its gathering of wanderers from
every corner of Europe, speaking every European
tongue. Neuilly was as busy as it well might be
about its yearly business, and could scarcely have
made more fuss and noise and pother if it had known
that not only the King of France, but every crowned
head in Christendom, proposed to pay it a visit.
</p>
<p>
A little way from Neuilly, to the Paris side of
the fair, there stood a small wayside inn, which was
perched comfortably enough on a bank of the river.
It was called, no one knew why, the Inn of the Three
Graces, and had, like many another wayside inn in
France, its pleasant benches before the doors for
open-air drinkers, and its not unpleasant darkened
rooms inside for wassail in stormy weather; also it
had quite a large orchard and garden behind it running
down to the river&#8217;s edge, where the people of
the Inn raised good fruit and good vegetables, which
added materially to the excellence of their homely
table. The high-road that skirted the Inn encountered,
a little way above it, a bridge that spanned the
river and continued its way to Neuilly and the fair
and the world beyond. At one side of the Inn was
a little space of common land, on which, at this time
of fair-making, a company of gypsies were encamped,
with their caravans and their ragged tents and their
camp-fires. On the other side of the Inn were some
agreeably arranged arbors, in whose shadow tables
and chairs were disposed for the benefit of those who
desired to taste the air with their wine and viands.
Taking it in an amiable spirit, the Inn of the Three
Graces seemed a very commendable place.
</p>
<p>
All day long on the day of which we speak, and
all day long for many days preceding it, there had
been a steady flow of folk from the direction of
Paris making in the direction of Neuilly, and not
a few of these, taken by the appearance of the little
wayside Inn, found it agreeable to refresh themselves
by slaking their thirst and staying their
stomachs inside or outside of its hospitable walls.
The most of those that so passed were sight-seers,
and these the Inn saw again as they passed homeward
in the dusk or sometimes even in the darkness
with the aid of flambeaux and lanterns. But
a certain number were, as might be said, professional
pedestrians, peddlers with their packs upon their
shoulders, anxious to dispose of ribbons and trinkets
to gaping rustics, easily bubbled burgesses, and to
the more wary histrions and mountebanks, for whom
a different scale of charges ranged.
</p>
<p>
A little after noon on the day in question the
wayside Inn of the Three Graces was quiet enough.
The last chance visitor had emptied his can and
crossed the bridge to Neuilly and its delights; the
last peddler had slung his pack and tramped in the
same direction; the gypsies, who since early morning
had sprawled upon the common land, had shaken
themselves free from their idleness into an assumption
of activity, and had marched off almost in a
body to take their share in the profits of the occasion
by a little judicious horse-coping and fortune-telling.
One of their number, indeed, they left behind in the
great, gaudy, green-and-red caravan that stood in
front of all the other caravans in the middle of the
grassy space&mdash;one of their number who would much
have preferred the merriment and the sunlight of
the fair to the confinement of the caravan, but who
remained in the caravan, nevertheless, because she
had to do what she was told.
</p>
<p>
The neighborhood of the Inn, therefore, seemed
strangely deserted when a man appeared upon the
bridge in the direction contrary to that of the general
stream of passers-by, for this man was coming from
the direction of Neuilly and was going in the direction
of Paris. He was a twisted man with a hunched
back, who was clad in black and carried a long
sword, and he came slowly down the slope of the
bridge and along the road to the Inn, looking about
him quickly and cautiously the while as he did so.
He had the air of one resolved to be alert against
possible surprises even where surprises were improbable
if not impossible; but his sinister face wore
a malign smile of self-confidence which proclaimed
that its wearer felt himself to be proof against all
dangers.

<h3>ÆSOP REDUX</h3>
</div>

<p>
Seeing that the neighborhood was vacant of
all occupants, the hunchback advanced to the
Inn, and, seating himself at a table under one of the
little arbors, drummed lustily with his clinched fist
upon the board. In answer to this summons the
landlord appeared hurriedly at the door&mdash;such a
man as had evidently been destined by heaven to
play the part of landlord of a wayside inn.
</p>
<p>
He advanced and questioned his guest obsequiously:
"Your honor wants&mdash;"
</p>
<p>
The hunchback answered him, roughly: "Wine,
good wine. If you bring me sour runnings I&#8217;ll break
your head."
</p>
<p>
The landlord bowed with a dipping upward projection
of apologetic hands. "Your honor shall have
my best."
</p>
<p>
The landlord went back into the Inn, and the
hunchback sprawled at his ease, tilting back his
chair and resting his lean, black legs on the table.
He sat thus wise for some little time, blinking under
the shadow of his large, black hat at the pleasant
sunlight and the pleasant grasses about him with
something of the sour air of one to whom such pleasant
things meant little. But presently his careless
eyes, that might almost have seemed to be asleep,
so much were the lids lowered, suddenly grew alert
again. A man appeared on the bridge&mdash;a lank, lean,
yellow-skinned man, with a face that seemed carved
out of old ivory, with furtive eyes and a fawning
mouth. The new-comer was gorgeously, over-gorgeously,
dressed, and his every movement affected the
manners of a grand seigneur. He carried a tall
cane with a jewelled knob, on which his left hand
rested affectionately, as if it pleased him, even in
this form, to handle and control costly things.
Precious laces extravagantly lapped his unattractive
hands. A sword with a jewelled hilt hung from his
side. The moment the new-comer saw the hunchback
he hastened towards him, but the hunchback,
for his part, for all his plain habit, showed no deference
to the splendidly dressed gentleman who saluted
him. He remained in his easy, sprawling attitude,
his chair still tilted back, his thin legs still lolling
on the table. The magnificent gentleman addressed
him with a certain air of condescension in his voice:
</p>
<p>
"Good-morning, Æsop. You are punctual. A
merit."
</p>
<p>
Æsop, without rising or showing any deference in his
manner, answered with a scarcely veiled note of insolence
in his voice: "Good-morning, Monsieur Peyrolles.
You are not punctual. A defect. Sit down."
</p>
<p>
Peyrolles, apparently somewhat dashed by the coolness
of his reception, obeyed the injunction of the
hunchback and seated himself, but he still forced the
show of condescension into his manner and strove
to maintain it in his voice as he continued the conversation.
"Though it&#8217;s&mdash;let me see&mdash;why, it&#8217;s seventeen
years since we met&mdash;I knew you at once."
</p>
<p>
Æsop grunted: "Well, I knew you at once, if it
comes to that, though the time was no shorter."
</p>
<p>
Peyrolles smiled awkwardly. "You haven&#8217;t
changed," he observed.
</p>
<p>
Æsop&#8217;s eyes travelled with a careful and contemptuous
scrutiny over the person of his old employer.
"You have. You didn&#8217;t wear quite such fine
clothes when I saw you last, my friend. What luck
it is to have a master who makes a rich marriage!"
</p>
<p>
As he said these words the landlord emerged
from the Inn with a tray in his hands that bore a
bottle and glasses. As he approached, Æsop swung
his legs off the table and resumed the ordinary attitude
of a feaster. The landlord placed the tray on
the table, thankfully accepted Æsop&#8217;s money, and
with many salutations returned to the shelter of the
Inn. Æsop filled two glasses with a shining white
wine and pushed one to Peyrolles. "Drink!" he
said, gruffly.
</p>
<p>
Peyrolles waved his yellow fingers in polite refusal.
"I thank you. No."
</p>
<p>
In a second Æsop had sprung to his feet angrily,
and, leaning over the table, thrust his own twisted
visage close to the yellow mask in front of him.
"Damn you!" he screamed&mdash;"damn you! are you
too proud to drink with a man who has travelled all
the way from Madrid on your dirty business? Let
me tell you&mdash;"
</p>
<p>
The man&#8217;s attitude of menace, the man&#8217;s violent
words, clearly alarmed Monsieur Peyrolles, who interrupted
him nervously with a voice quavering with
protestation: "No, no, you need not. Of course,
not too proud. Delighted."
</p>
<p>
Æsop dropped into his seat again. "That&#8217;s better.
Your health." He lifted the glass to his lips as he
spoke and slowly drained it. There was no sound
of solicitation for his companion&#8217;s welfare in his
words, there was no expression of pleasure on his face
as he did so. He took the good wine as he took all
bright and kindly things, sourly.
</p>
<p>
Peyrolles hastened to follow the example of his
pledge. "Your health," he said, and sipped diffidently
at the wine, and then, finding it agreeable,
finished it.
</p>
<p>
There was a little pause, and then Æsop spoke
again.
</p>
<p>
"Seventeen years," he murmured, with a chuckle&mdash;"seventeen
years since we last met, on the morning,
as I remember, after the little mishap in the moat of
Caylus."
</p>
<p>
Peyrolles shivered, and seemed uneasy. Æsop paid
no heed to his evident discomfort.
</p>
<p>
"What a wild-goose chase you sent us all on, I and
Staupitz and the others&mdash;flying into Spain to find
Lagardere and the child. The others hunted for him,
as I suppose you know, with the results which, also,
I suppose you know."
</p>
<p>
Peyrolles nodded feebly. His yellow face was several
tinges yellower, his teeth seemed to threaten to
chatter, and he looked very unhappy. His voice
was grave as he spoke: "Those who did find him
were not fortunate." Æsop laughed.
</p>
<p>
"They were fools," he asserted. "Well, for my
part, I said to myself that the wise course for me to
follow was not to waste my strength, my energy, and
my breath in chasing Lagardere all over a peninsula,
but to wait quietly for Lagardere to come to me.
Madrid, I reasoned, is the centre of Spain; everyone
in Spain comes to Madrid sooner or later; <i>ergo</i>, sooner
or later Lagardere will come to Madrid."
</p>
<p>
"Well, did he?" Peyrolles asked, forcing himself
to give tongue, and eying the hunchback dubiously.
He found Æsop too humorous for his fancy. Æsop
grinned like a monkey whose nuts have been filched.
</p>
<p>
"No," he said&mdash;"no, not as yet, to my knowledge,
or he would be dead. But I have a conviction that
our paths will cross one day, and when that day comes
you may be sorry for Lagardere if your heart is inclined
to be pitiful."
</p>
<p>
The unpleasant expression on Monsieur Peyrolles&#8217;s
face whenever the name of Lagardere was mentioned
now deepened sufficiently to make it quite plain that
he cherished no such inclination. Æsop went on:
</p>
<p>
"He proved himself a pretty good swordsman on
the night of the&mdash;shall we say altercation?&mdash;and he
certainly succeeded in persuading me that there was
something to be said for those secret thrusts that I
treated too lightly. When I first met Lagardere I
knew all that Italy and all that France could teach
me of sword-play. Now I know all that Spain can
teach. I tell you, friend Peyrolles, I think I am the
best swordsman alive."
</p>
<p>
Peyrolles did not at all like to be hailed as friend in
this familiar manner by the hunchback, but he had
his reasons for mastering his feelings, and he showed
no signs of distaste. Perhaps he had begun to realize
that Æsop would not mind in the least if he did manifest
displeasure.
</p>
<p>
"Now, finding myself in Madrid," Æsop resumed,
"and not being inclined to follow the foolish example
of my companions, which led each of them in turn to
you know what, I cast about to make myself comfortable
in Madrid. I soon found a way. I set up
an excellent bagnio; I lured rich youths to the altars
and alcoves of play and pleasure. I made a
great deal of money, and enjoyed myself very much
incidentally. It is always a pleasure to me to see
straight, smooth, suave men killing themselves with
sweet sins."
</p>
<p>
The expression of his face was so hideous, as he
spoke in his demoniacal air of triumph over those that
were less afflicted than himself, that Peyrolles, who
was not at all squeamish, shuddered uncomfortably.
Æsop seemed for a while to be absorbed in soothing
memories, but presently he made an end of rubbing
his hands together silently, and resumed his speech:
</p>
<p>
"It was all in the way of my ancient and honorable
trade to have no small traffic with pretty women
and the friends of pretty women and the parents of
pretty women. And it was this part of my trade
which put the idea into my head which prompted
me to write to you, friend Peyrolles, and which persuaded
me to uproot myself from my comfortable
house and my responsive doxies, and jog all the way
from Madrid to Paris."
</p>
<p>
The sense of what he had sacrificed in making the
journey seemed suddenly to gall him, for he glared
ferociously at Peyrolles, and said, sharply: "Here
have I been talking myself dry while you sit mumchance.
Tell me some tale for a change. Why in the
name of the ancient devil did Nevers&#8217;s widow marry
Gonzague?"
</p>
<p>
Peyrolles laughed feebly. "Love, I suppose."
</p>
<p>
Æsop waved the suggestion away. "Don&#8217;t talk
like a fool. I expect old Caylus made her. He was
a grim old chip, after my own heart, and our widow
had no friends. Oh yes; I expect daddy Caylus
made her marry Gonzague. What a joke!&mdash;what an
exquisite joke!"
</p>
<p>
Peyrolles replied, with attempted dignity: "You
didn&#8217;t travel all the way from Madrid to talk about
my master&#8217;s marriage, I suppose."
</p>
<p>
In a moment Æsop&#8217;s manner became ferocious again.
Again he thrust forward his seamed, malicious face,
and again the yellow mask drew back from it. "You
are right, I did not. I came because I am tired of
Spain, because I lust for Paris, because I desire to
enter the service of his Highness Prince Louis de
Gonzague, to whom I am about to render a very
great service."
</p>
<p>
Peyrolles looked at him thoughtfully, the yellow
mask wrinkled with dubiety. "Are you serious about
this service?" he asked. "Can you really perform
what your letter seemed to promise?"
</p>
<p>
"I should not have travelled all this way if I did
not know what I was about," Æsop growled. "I
think it matters little if I have lost Lagardere if I
have found the daughter of Nevers."
</p>
<p>
Peyrolles was thoroughly interested, and leaned
eagerly across the table. "Then you think you have
found her?"
</p>
<p>
Æsop grinned at him maliciously. "As good as
found her. I have found a girl who may be&mdash;come,
let&#8217;s put a bold face on it and say must be&mdash;Nevers&#8217;s
daughter. I told you so much in my letter."
</p>
<p>
Peyrolles now drew back again with a cautious
look on his face as he answered, cautiously: "My
master, Prince Gonzague, must be satisfied. Where
is this girl?"
</p>
<p>
Æsop continued: "Here. I found her in Madrid,
the dancing-girl of a band of gypsies. She is the right
age. The girl is clever, she is comely, her hair is of
the Nevers shade, her color of the Nevers tint. She
is, by good-fortune, still chaste, for when I first began
to think of this scheme the minx was little more
than a child, and the gypsies, who were willing to do
my bidding, kept her clean for my need. Oh, she
has been well prepared, I promise you! She has been
taught to believe that she was stolen from her parents
in her babyhood, and will meet any fable half-way.
She will make a most presentable heiress to the gentleman
we killed at Caylus&mdash;"
</p>
<p>
Peyrolles agitated his yellow hands deprecatingly.
He did not like the revival of unpleasant memories.
"My good friend!" he protested.
</p>
<p>
Æsop eyed him with disdain. "Well, we did kill
him, didn&#8217;t we? You don&#8217;t want to pretend that
he&#8217;s alive now, after that jab in the back your master
gave him fifteen years ago?"
</p>
<p>
Peyrolles wriggled on his chair in an agony of
discomfort. "Hush, for Heaven&#8217;s sake! Don&#8217;t talk
like that!"
</p>
<p>
Æsop slapped the table till the glasses rang. "I&#8217;ll
talk as I please."
</p>
<p>
Peyrolles saw it was useless to argue with the
hunchback, and submitted. "Yes, yes; but let bygones
be bygones. About this girl?"
</p>
<p>
Æsop resumed his narrative. "I sent her and her
tribe Franceward from Madrid. I didn&#8217;t accompany
them, for I&#8217;m not fond of companionship; but
I told them to wait me here, and here they are.
What place could be more excellent? All sorts of
vagabonds come hither from all parts of the world
at fair-time. How natural that your admirable
master should amuse his leisure by visiting the
fair, and in so diverting himself be struck by a
beautiful gypsy girl&#8217;s resemblance to the features of
his dear dead friend! It is all a romance, friend
Peyrolles, and a very good romance. And I, Æsop,
made it."
</p>
<p>
The hunchback struck an attitude as he spoke, and
strove to twist his evil countenance into a look of
inspiration.
</p>
<p>
Peyrolles was all eagerness now. "Let me see the
girl," he pleaded.
</p>
<p>
Æsop shook his head. "By-and-by. It is understood
that if Gonzague accepts the girl as Nevers&#8217;s
child he takes me into his service in Paris. Eh?"
</p>
<p>
Peyrolles nodded. "That is understood."
</p>
<p>
Æsop yawned on the conclusion of the bargain.
"Curse me if I see why he wants the child when he
has got the mother."
</p>
<p>
Peyrolles again neared, and spoke with a lowered
voice: "I can be frank with you, master Æsop?"
</p>
<p>
"It&#8217;s the best plan," Æsop growled.
</p>

<h2>XII</h2>
<h3>FLORA</h3>
</div>

<p>
Peyrolles prepared to be frank. He put up
his hand, and whispered behind it cautiously:
"The married life of the Prince de Gonzague and
the widow of Nevers has not been ideally happy."
</p>
<p>
Æsop grinned at him in derision. "You surprise
me!" he commented, ironically.
</p>
<p>
Peyrolles went on: "The marriage is only a marriage
in name. What arguments succeeded in persuading
so young a widow to marry again so soon I
do not, of course, know." He paused for a moment
and frowned a little, for Æsop, though saying nothing,
was lolling out his tongue at him mockingly. Then
he went on, with a somewhat ruffled manner: "At
all events, whatever the arguments were, they succeeded,
and the Duchess de Nevers became the Princess
de Gonzague. After the ceremony the Princess
de Gonzague told her husband that she lived only
in the hope of recovering her child, and that she
would kill herself if she were not left in peace."
</p>
<p>
He paused for a moment. Æsop spurred him on:
"Well, go on, go on."
</p>
<p>
Peyrolles cleared his throat. Being frank was
neither habitual nor pleasant. "As the princess
had absolute control of the wealth of her dead
husband, the Duke de Nevers, and as she promised
to allow my master the use of her fortune as long
as he&mdash;"
</p>
<p>
Again he paused, and Æsop interpolated: "Left
her in peace."
</p>
<p>
Peyrolles accepted the suggestion. "Exactly&mdash;my
master, who is a perfect gentleman, accepted the situation.
Since that day they seldom meet, seldom
speak. The princess always wears mourning&mdash;"
</p>
<p>
Æsop shivered. "Cheerful spouse."
</p>
<p>
Peyrolles went on: "While the Prince de Gonzague
lives a bright life, and sets the mode in wit, dress,
vice&mdash;in every way the perfect gentleman, and now
the favorite companion and friend of his melancholy
majesty, whose natural sadness at the loss of the great
cardinal he does his best to alleviate."
</p>
<p>
Æsop laughed mockingly as Peyrolles mouthed his
approvals. "Lucky groom. But if he can spend
the money, why does he want the girl?"
</p>
<p>
Peyrolles answered, promptly: "To please the princess,
and prove himself the devoted husband."
</p>
<p>
Æsop was persistent: "What is the real reason?"
</p>
<p>
Peyrolles, with a grimace, again consented to be
frank: "As Mademoiselle de Nevers is not proved
to be dead, the law assumes her to be alive, and it
is as the guardian of this impalpable young person
that my dear master handles the revenues of Nevers.
If she were certainly dead, my master would inherit."
</p>
<p>
Æsop still required information. "Then why the
devil does he want to prove that she lives?"
</p>
<p>
There was again a touch of condescension in Peyrolles&#8217;s
manner: "You are not so keen as you think,
good Æsop. Mademoiselle de Nevers, recovered, restored
to her mother&#8217;s arms, the recognized heiress
of so much wealth, might seem to be a very lucky
young woman. But even lucky young women are
not immortal."
</p>
<p>
Æsop chuckled. "Oh, oh, oh! If the lost-and-found
young lady were to die soon after her recovery
the good Louis de Gonzague would inherit without
further question. I fear my little gypsy is not promised
a long life."
</p>
<p>
Peyrolles smiled sourly. "Let me see your little
gypsy."
</p>
<p>
Æsop hesitated for a moment. It evidently went
against his grain to oblige Peyrolles&mdash;or, for that
matter, any man, in anything; but in this instance
to oblige served his own turn. He rose, and, passing
the door of the Inn, crossed the space of common
land to where the caravan stood, a deserted monument
of green and red.
</p>
<p>
The hunchback tapped at the door and whispered
through the lock: "Are you there, Flora?"
</p>
<p>
A woman&#8217;s voice answered from within&mdash;a young
voice, a sweet voice, a slightly impatient voice.
"Yes," it said.
</p>
<p>
"Come out," Æsop commanded, curtly.
</p>
<p>
Then the gaudy door of the caravan yielded, and
a pretty gypsy girt appeared in the opening. She
was dark-haired, she was bright-eyed, she was
warmly colored. She seemed to be about eighteen
years of age, but her figure already had a rich Spanish
fulness and her carriage was swaying and voluptuous.
Most men would have been glad enough to stand for
a while in adoration of so pleasing a picture, but Æsop
was not as most men. His attitude to women when
they concerned him personally was not of adoration.
In this case the girl did not concern him personally,
and he had no interest in her youth or her charms
save in so far as they might serve the business he
had in hand.
</p>
<p>
The girl looked at him with a little frown, and
spoke with a little note of fretfulness in her voice:
"So you have come at last. I have been so tired of
waiting for you, mewed up in there."
</p>
<p>
Æsop answered her, roughly: "That&#8217;s my business.
Here is a gentleman who wants to speak with you."
</p>
<p>
As he spoke he beckoned to Peyrolles, who rose
from his seat and moved with what he considered
to be dignity towards the pair, making great play
of cane, great play of handkerchief, great play of
jewelled-hilted sword flapping against neatly stockinged
leg.
</p>
<p>
He saluted the gypsy in what he conceived to be
the grand manner. "Can you tell fortunes, pretty
one?"
</p>
<p>
The gypsy laughed, and showed good teeth as she
did so. "Surely, on the palm or with the cards&mdash;all
ways."
</p>
<p>
"Can you tell your own fortune?" Peyrolles questioned,
with a faint tinge of malice in the words.
</p>
<p>
Flora laughed again, and answered, unhesitatingly:
"To dance my way through the world, to enjoy myself
as much as I can in the sunshine, to please pretty
gentlemen, to have money to spend, to wear fine
clothes and do nice things and enjoy myself, to laugh
often and cry little. That is my fortune, I hope."
</p>
<p>
Peyrolles shook his head and looked very wise.
"Perhaps I can tell you a better fortune."
</p>
<p>
Flora was impressed by the manner of the grand
gentleman, for to her he seemed a grand gentleman.
"Tell me, quick!" she entreated.
</p>
<p>
Peyrolles condescended to explain: "Seventeen
years ago a girl of noble birth, one year old, was
stolen from her mother and given to gypsies."
</p>
<p>
Flora, listening, counted on her fingers: "Seventeen,
one, eighteen&mdash;why, just my age."
</p>
<p>
Peyrolles approved. "You are hearing the voice
of Nature&mdash;excellent."
</p>
<p>
Æsop put in his word: "That mother has been
looking for her child ever since."
</p>
<p>
Peyrolles summed up the situation with a malign
smile: "We believe we have found her."
</p>
<p>
Flora began to catch the drift of the conversation,
and was eager for more knowledge. "Go on&mdash;go on!
I always dreamed of being a great lady."
</p>
<p>
Peyrolles raised a chastening finger. "Patience,
child, patience. The prince, my master, honors the
fair to-day in company with a most exalted personage.
I will bring him here to see you dance. If he recognizes
you, your fortune is made."
</p>
<p>
Flora questioned, cunningly: "How can he recognize
a child of one?"
</p>
<p>
Peyrolles lifted to his eyes the elaborately laced
kerchief he had been carrying in his right hand, and
appeared to be a prey to violent emotions. "Your
father was his dearest friend," he murmured, in a
tearful voice. "He would see his features in you."
</p>
<p>
Flora clapped her hands. "I hope he will."
</p>
<p>
Æsop, looking cynically from the girl to the man
and from the man to the girl, commented, dryly:
"I think he will."
</p>
<p>
Peyrolles considered the interview had lasted long
enough. He signed to the girl to retire with the air
of a grandee dismissing some vassal. "Enough. Retire
to your van till I come for you."
</p>
<p>
Flora pouted and pleaded: "Don&#8217;t be long. I&#8217;m
tired of being in there."
</p>
<p>
Æsop snapped at her, sharply: "Do as you are told.
You are not a princess yet."
</p>
<p>
The girl frowned, the girl&#8217;s eyes flashed, but her
acquaintance with Æsop had given her the thoroughly
justifiable impression that he was a man whom it
was better to obey, and she retired into the caravan
and shut the green-and-red door with a bang behind
her.
</p>
<p>
Æsop turned with a questioning grin to Peyrolles.
"Well?" he said.
</p>
<p>
Peyrolles looked approval. "I think she&#8217;ll do.
I&#8217;ll go and find the prince at once."
</p>
<p>
"I will go a little way with you," Æsop said, more
perhaps because he thought his company might exasperate
the sham grand man than for any other
reason. He knew Peyrolles would think it unbecoming
his dignity to be seen in close companionship
with the shabbily habited hunchback, hence his display
of friendship. As he linked his black arm in the
yellow-satin arm of Peyrolles, he added: "I have
taken every care to make our tale seem plausible.
The gypsies will swear that they stole her seventeen
years ago."
</p>
<p>
Peyrolles nodded, looking askance at him, and
wishing that destiny had not compelled him to make
use of such an over-familiar agent, and the precious
pair went over the bridge together and disappeared
from the neighborhood of the little Inn, and the spirit
of solitude seemed again to brood over the locality.
But it was not suffered to brood for very long. As
soon as the voices and the footsteps of Peyrolles and
Æsop were no longer audible; the green-and-red door
of the caravan was again cautiously opened, and
cautiously the head of the pretty gypsy girl was
thrust out into the air. When she saw that the
pair had disappeared, she ran lightly down the steps
of the caravan, and, crossing the common, paused
under the windows of the Inn, where she began to
sing in a sweet, rich voice a verse of a Spanish
gypsy song:
</p>
<table summary='poetry'>
<col style='width:5em;' />

<h2>XIII</h2>
<h3>CONFIDENCES</h3>
</div>

<p>
Before she had finished the last line of the
verse the curtains of a window in the second
story of the Inn parted and another young girl
showed herself through the lattice. This girl was
dark-haired like the gypsy, and bright-eyed like the
gypsy, and, like the gypsy, she seemed to be some
eighteen years of age, but beyond these obvious features
resemblance ceased. The girl who looked down
from the window of the Inn was of a slenderer shape
than the gypsy, of a more delicate complexion, of a
grace and bearing that suggested different breeding
and another race than that of the more exuberant
Gitana. The girl at the window spoke in a clear,
sweet voice to the singer: "I thought it must be you,
Flora."
</p>
<p>
Flora called back to her: "Come down to me,
Gabrielle."
</p>
<p>
The girl Gabrielle shook her head. "Henri does
not wish me to go abroad while he is absent."
</p>
<p>
Flora made a little face. "Our friends do keep us
prisoners. There is not a soul about."
</p>
<p>
Gabrielle smiled and consented. "I will come for
a moment."
</p>
<p>
She withdrew from the window, and in a few minutes
she appeared at the Inn door and joined her
impatient friend. Flora kissed her affectionately,
and asked, between kisses: "Are you not angry with
Henri for keeping you thus caged?"
</p>
<p>
Gabrielle smiled an amused denial. "How could
I be angry with Henri? He has good reasons for
his deeds. We are in great danger. We have enemies."
</p>
<p>
Flora stared at her wild-eyed. "Who are your enemies?"
</p>
<p>
Gabrielle looked about her, as if to be assured that
no one was within hearing, and then whispered into
Flora&#8217;s ear: "Henri will never tell me, but they hunt
us down. Ever since I was a child we have fled
from place to place, hiding. I have often been roused
at night by clash of swords and Henri&#8217;s voice, crying:
&#8217;I am here!&#8217; But his sword is always the strongest,
and we have always escaped."
</p>
<p>
"Surely you will be safe in Paris," Flora said.
</p>
<p>
Gabrielle sighed. "Why, it seems we dare not enter
Paris yet. When we left Madrid in your company
Henri told me we were journeying to Paris,
but now we linger here outside the walls until Henri
has seen some one&mdash;I know not who; and while we
linger here I must keep in-doors."
</p>
<p>
Flora looked mischievous. "Perhaps Henri is jealous,
and tells this tale to keep you to himself."
</p>
<p>
Gabrielle sighed again: "Henri only thinks of me
as a child."
</p>
<p>
Flora still was mischievous. "But you know you
are not his child, and I am sure you do not think of
him as a father."
</p>
<p>
Gabrielle turned upon her friend with an air of
dainty imperiousness. "Flora, Flora, you may be
a witch, but there are some thoughts of mine you
must not presume to read."
</p>
<p>
Flora laughed. "You command like a great lady.
&#8217;Must not,&#8217; indeed, and &#8217;presume&#8217;! Let me tell you,
pretty Gabrielle, that I am the great lady here."
</p>
<p>
Gabrielle was instantly winning and tender again.
"You are my sweet friend, and I did not mean to
command you."
</p>
<p>
Flora laughed good-humoredly. "You should have
seen your air of greatness. But I am speaking seriously.
I believe I am the long-lost daughter of a
great lord."
</p>
<p>
Gabrielle stared, amazed. "Really, Flora, really?
Are you in earnest? Tell me all about it."
</p>
<p>
Flora looked like a gypsy sphinx. "Oh, but I may
not. I should not have spoken of it at all, but I am
so mad and merry at the good news that out it
slipped."
</p>
<p>
Gabrielle softly patted her cheek. "I am glad of
anything that makes you happy."
</p>
<p>
Flora tried to look magnificent. "Do not you
envy me? Would not you like to be a great lady,
too? I am afraid you look more like it than I do."
</p>
<p>
Gabrielle spoke again in a whisper: "I will tell
you my secret in return for yours. So long as I
can be by Henri&#8217;s side I envy no one&mdash;ask nothing
better of fortune."
</p>
<p>
Flora smiled knowingly. "Do you call that a
secret? I have known that ever since I first saw
you look at him."
</p>
<p>
Gabrielle looked pained. "Am I so immodest a
minion?"
</p>
<p>
Flora protested: "No, no. But your eyes are
traitors and tell me tales."
</p>
<p>
"I must be wary," Gabrielle said, "that they
tell no tales to&mdash;to others."
</p>
<p>
Flora shrugged her pretty shoulders. "Lovers are
droll. A maid may love a man, and a man may
love a maid, and neither know that the other is sick
of the same pip, poor fowls."
</p>
<p>
"What do you mean, witch?" Gabrielle questioned.
</p>
<p>
Flora twirled a pirouette before she replied: "Nothing&mdash;less
than nothing. I dance here by-and-by to
please a grandee. Will you peep through your lattice?"
</p>
<p>
"Perhaps," Gabrielle answered, cautiously. Then
she gave a little start. "Some one is coming," she
said, and, indeed, some one was coming. A man had
just mounted the bridge from the Neuilly road and
stood there for an instant surveying the two girls.
He was a modish young gentleman, very splendidly
attired, who carried himself with a dainty insolence,
and he now came slowly towards the girls with an
amiable salutation.
</p>
<p>
"Exquisite ladies," he said, "I give you good-day."
</p>
<p>
At the sound of his voice and the sight of his figure
Gabrielle had disappeared into the Inn as quickly
as ever rabbit disappeared into its hole. Flora had
no less nimbly run down to the caravan; but when
she reached it she paused on the first step, attracted
by the appearance of the handsomely dressed young
gentleman, who appealed to her earnestly: "Why do
you scatter so rashly? I should be delighted to talk
with you."
</p>
<p>
Flora mocked him: "Perhaps we do not want
to talk to you."
</p>
<p>
The new-comer would not admit the possibility.
"Impossible," he protested. "Let me present myself.
I am the Marquis de Chavernay. I am very
diverting. I can make love to more ladies at the
same time than any gentleman of my age at court."
</p>
<p>
Flora laughed. "Amiable accomplishment," she
said, mockingly; but while she mocked her quick
eyes were carefully noting every particular of the
stranger&#8217;s appearance, from the exquisite laces at
his throat and wrists to the jewels on his fingers,
and finding all very much to her taste, and the appropriate
adornments for a young gentleman of so
gallant a carriage and so pleasantly impertinent a
face. She had never cast her eyes upon any youth
in Madrid that had captivated her fancy so mightily,
and she thought to herself that when the time came
for her to have a lover here was the very lover she
would choose. And then she remembered, with a
fluttering heart, that she was likely to become a great
lady and the peer of this fascinating dandiprat. As
for him, he returned her gaze with a bold stare of
approval.
</p>
<p>
The Marquis de Chavernay agitated his dainty
hands in delicate assurance. "Agreeable, believe
me," he asserted; and then asked: "Why has your
sister nymph retreated from the field? I could entertain
the pair of you."
</p>
<p>
As Flora&#8217;s only answer to this assurance was a
further, though perhaps not very earnest, effort to
enter the caravan, he restrained her with appealing
voice and gesture: "Please do not go."
</p>
<p>
Flora looked at him quizzically. "Why should I
stay, pretty gentleman?"
</p>
<p>
The little marquis made her a bow. "Because
you can do me a service, pretty lady. Is there an
inn hereabouts at the sign of the Three Graces?"
</p>
<p>
Flora was curious. "Why do you want to know?"
</p>
<p>
The little marquis wore a mysterious look, as if all
the political secrets of the period were shut in his
heart or head, and he lowered his voice as he answered:
"Because I am commissioned to ascertain its
whereabouts for a friend."
</p>
<p>
Flora laughed, and pointed to the Inn into which
Gabrielle had retreated. "You have not far to seek
to oblige your friend," she said. "There it stands
behind you."
</p>
<p>
Chavernay swung round on his heels, and surveyed
the modest little hostelry with amusement. "The
shelter of the fugitive nymph. Oh, now I understand
my friend&#8217;s anxiety! Pretty child, my duty
forces me to leave you when my inclination would
fling me into your arms. If I may wait upon you
later&mdash;"
</p>
<p>
This time Flora had evidently made up her mind
that it would be indiscreet of her further to prolong
the colloquy. She dipped him a courtesy, half mocking
and half respectful, wished him good-day, and,
diving into the caravan, slammed the door in his face.
The little marquis seemed at first astonished at the
austerity of the gypsy girl.
</p>
<p>
"Dido retires to her cave," he thought to himself.
"Shall Æneas pursue?" He made for a moment
as if to advance and force his company upon the
seeming reluctant damsel. Then his volatile thoughts
flickered back to the girl who had entered the Inn.
"Methinks," he reflected, "I would as soon play
Paris to yonder Helen. But I must not keep his
Majesty waiting. No wonder he seeks the Inn of
the Three Graces." For it was plain to the little
gentleman that he had now discovered the reason
why his august master and sovereign had done him
the honor to select him as scout to find out the
whereabouts of the unknown tavern.
</p>

<a name='XIV_I_AM_HERE' id='XIV_I_AM_HERE'></a>
<h2>XIV</h2>
<h3>"I AM HERE!"</h3>
</div>

<p>
Pleased at the success of his mission, although
disappointed at not having made further progress
in the graces of the two girls whom he was
pleased to regard as shepherdesses, he cast his eye
first to the shut door of the caravan and then to the
silent face of the tavern, and was about to rejoin his
illustrious master with all speed when his attention
was arrested by a singular figure advancing towards
him from the Paris road. This person was tall and
thin and bony, with a weakly amiable face fringed
with flaxen hair, and timid eyes that blinked under
pink eyelids. He was dressed in black clothes of
an extreme shabbiness, and the only distinguishing
feature of his appearance was a particularly long
and formidable sword that flapped against his calves.
The fellow was at once so fantastic and so ridiculous
that Chavernay, whose sense of humor was always
lively, regarded him with much curiosity and at the
same time with affected dismay.
</p>
<p>
"Is this ogre," he wondered to himself, "one of
the protecting giants who guard the fair nymphs of
this place, or is he rather some cruel guardian appointed
by the enchanter, who denies them intercourse
with agreeable mankind?" Thus Chavernay
mused, affecting the fancies of some fashionable
romance; and then, finding that his attentions appeared
strangely to embarrass the angular individual
in black, he turned on his heels to make for
the bridge, and again came to a halt, for on the
bridge appeared another figure as grotesque as the
first-comer, but grotesque in a wholly different manner.
</p>
<p>
This second stranger was as burly as the first was
lean, and as gaudy in his apparel as the first was
simple. The petals of the iris, the plumes of the
peacock seemed to have been pillaged by him for
the colors that made up his variegated wardrobe. A
purple pourpoint, crimson breeches, an amber-colored
cloak, and a huge hat with a blue feather set off a
figure of extravagantly martial presence. Where the
face of the first-comer was pale, insignificant, and
timid, that of the second-comer was ruddy, assertive,
and bold. The only point in common with his predecessor
was that he, too, swung at his side a monstrous
rapier. The sight of this whimsical stranger was too
much for Chavernay&#8217;s self-restraint, and he burst
into a hearty fit of laughter, which he made no effort
to control.
</p>
<p>
"What a scarecrow!" he muttered, looking back
at the individual in black. "What a gorgon!" he continued,
as his eyes travelled to the man in motley.
"Gog and Magog, by Heavens!" he commented, as he
surveyed the astonishing pair.
</p>
<p>
Then, still laughing, he ran across the bridge and
left the two objects of his mirth glaring after him in
indignation. Indeed, so indignant were they, and so
steadily did they keep their angry eyes fixed upon
the retreating figure of the marquis, while each continued
his original course of progression, that the
two men, heedless of each other, ran into each other
with an awkward thump that recalled to each of
them the fact that there were other persons in the
world as well as an impertinent gentleman with
nimble heels. The man in black and the man in
many colors each clapped a hand to a sword-hilt,
only to withdraw it instantly and extend it in sign
of amicable greeting.
</p>
<p>
"Passepoil!" cried the man in many colors.
</p>
<p>
"Cocardasse!" cried the man in black.
</p>
<p>
"To my arms, brother, to my arms!" cried Cocardasse,
and in a moment the amazing pair were clasped
in each other&#8217;s embrace.
</p>
<p>
"Is it really you?" said Cocardasse, when he thought
the embrace had lasted long enough, holding Passepoil
firmly by the shoulders and gazing fixedly into
his pale, pathetic face.
</p>
<p>
Passepoil nodded. "Truly. What red star guides
you to Paris?"
</p>
<p>
Cocardasse dropped his voice to a whisper. "I had
a letter."
</p>
<p>
Passepoil whispered in reply: "So had I."
</p>
<p>
Cocardasse amplified: "My letter told me to be
outside the Inn of the Three Graces, near Neuilly, on
a certain day&mdash;this day&mdash;to serve the Prince of Gonzague."
</p>
<p>
Passepoil nodded again. "So did mine."
</p>
<p>
Cocardasse continued: "Mine enclosed a draft on
the Bank of Marseilles to pay expenses."
</p>
<p>
Passepoil noted a point of difference: "Mine was
on the Bank of Calais."
</p>
<p>
"I suppose Gonzague wants all that are left of us,"
Cocardasse said, thoughtfully.
</p>
<p>
Passepoil sighed significantly. "There aren&#8217;t
many."
</p>
<p>
Cocardasse looked as gloomy as was possible for
one of his rubicund countenance and jolly bearing.
"Lagardere has kept his word."
</p>
<p>
"Staupitz was killed at Seville," Passepoil murmured,
as one who begins a catalogue of disasters.
</p>
<p>
Cocardasse continued: "Faenza was killed at Burgos."
</p>
<p>
Passepoil went on: "Saldagno at Toledo."
</p>
<p>
Cocardasse took up the tale: "Pinto at Valladolid."
</p>
<p>
Passepoil concluded the catalogue: "Joel at Grenada,
Pepe at Cordova."
</p>
<p>
"All with the same wound," Cocardasse commented,
with a curious solemnity in his habitually jovial
voice.
</p>
<p>
Passepoil added, lugubriously: "The thrust between
the eyes."
</p>
<p>
Cocardasse summed up, significantly: "The thrust
of Nevers."
</p>
<p>
The pair were silent for an instant, looking at each
other with something like dismay upon their faces,
and their minds were evidently busy with old days
and old dangers.
</p>
<p>
Passepoil broke the silence. "They didn&#8217;t make
much by their blood-money."
</p>
<p>
"Yes," said Cocardasse; "but we, who refused to
hunt Lagardere, we are alive."
</p>
<p>
Passepoil cast a melancholy glance over his own
dingy habiliments and then over the garments of
Cocardasse, garments which, although glowing enough
in color, were over-darned and over-patched to suggest
opulence. "In a manner," he said, dryly.
</p>
<p>
Cocardasse drew himself up proudly and slapped
his chest. "Poor but honest."
</p>
<p>
Passepoil allowed a faint smile, expressive of satisfaction,
to steal over his melancholy countenance.
"Thank Heaven, in Paris we can&#8217;t meet Lagardere."
</p>
<p>
Cocardasse appeared plainly to share the pleasure
of his old friend. "An exile dare not return," he
said, emphatically, with the air of a man who feels
sure of himself and of his words. But it is the way
of destiny very often, even when a man is surest of
himself and surest of his words, to interpose some
disturbing factor in his confident calculations, to
make some unexpected move upon the chess-board
of existence, which altogether baffles his plans and
ruins his hopes. So many people had crossed the
bridge that morning that it really seemed little less
than probable that the appearance of a fresh pedestrian
upon its arch could have any serious effect
upon the satisfactory reflections of the two bravos.
Yet at that moment a man did appear upon the
bridge, who paused and surveyed Cocardasse and
Passepoil, whose backs were towards him, with a significant
smile.
</p>
<p>
The new-comer was humbly clad, very much in the
fashion of one of those gypsies who had pitched their
camp so close to the wayside tavern; but if the man&#8217;s
clothes were something of the gypsy habit, he carried
a sword under his ragged mantle, and it was plain
from the man&#8217;s face that he was not a gypsy. His
handsome, daring, humorous face, bronzed by many
suns and lined a little by many experiences&mdash;a face
that in its working mobility and calm inscrutability
might possibly have been the countenance of a strolling
player&mdash;was the face of a man still in the prime
of life, and carrying his years as lightly as if he were
still little more than a lad. He moved noiselessly
from the bridge to the high-road, and came cautiously
upon the swashbucklers at the very moment when
Passepoil was saying, with a shiver: "I&#8217;m always
afraid to hear Lagardere&#8217;s voice cry out Nevers&#8217;s
motto."
</p>
<p>
Even on the instant the man in the gypsy habit
pushed his way between the two bandits, laying a
hand on each of their shoulders and saying three
words: "I am here!"
</p>
<p>
Cocardasse and Passepoil fell apart, each with the
same cry in the same amazed voice.
</p>
<p>
"Lagardere!" said Cocardasse, and his ruddy face
paled.
</p>
<p>
"Lagardere!" said Passepoil, and his pale face
flushed.
</p>
<p>
As for Lagardere, he laughed heartily at their confusion.
"You are like scared children whose nurse
hears bogey in the chimney."
</p>
<p>
Cocardasse strove to seem amused. "Children!"
he said, with a forced laugh, and it was with a forced
laugh that Passepoil repeated the word "Bogey."
</p>
<p>
For a moment the good-humor faded from the face
of Lagardere, and he spoke grimly enough: "There
were nine assassins in the moat at Caylus. How
many are left now?"
</p>
<p>
"Only three," Cocardasse answered.
</p>
<p>
Passepoil was more precise. "Cocardasse and myself
and Æsop."
</p>
<p>
Lagardere looked at them mockingly. "Doesn&#8217;t
it strike you that Æsop will soon be alone?"
</p>
<p>
Cocardasse shuddered. "It&#8217;s no laughing matter."
</p>
<p>
Lagardere still continued to smile. "Vengeance
sometimes wears a sprightly face and smiles while
she strikes."
</p>
<p>
Passepoil was now a sickly green. "A very painful
humor," he stammered.
</p>
<p>
There was an awkward pause, and then Cocardasse
suddenly spoke in a decisive tone. "Captain,
you have no right to kill us," he growled, and Passepoil,
nodding his long head, repeated his companion&#8217;s
phrase with Norman emphasis.
</p>
<p>
Lagardere looked from one to the other of the
pair, and there was a twinkle in his eyes that reassured
them. "Are you scared, old knaves? No
explanations; let me speak. That night in Caylus,
seventeen years ago, when the darkness quivered
with swords, I did not meet your blades."
</p>
<p>
Cocardasse explained. "When you backed Nevers
we took no part in the scuffle."
</p>
<p>
"Nor did we join in hunting you later," Passepoil
added, hurriedly.
</p>
<p>
Lagardere&#8217;s face wore a look of satisfaction. "In
all the tumult of that tragic night I thought I saw
two figures standing apart&mdash;thought they might be,
must be, my old friends. That is why I have sent
for you."
</p>
<p>
"Sent for us?" Cocardasse echoed in astonishment.
</p>
<p>
"Was it you who&mdash;" Passepoil questioned, equally
surprised.
</p>
<p>
"Why, of course it was," Lagardere answered.
"Sit down and listen."
</p>
<p>
He led the way to the very table at which, such
a short time before, Æsop had sat with Peyrolles.
Now he and Cocardasse and Passepoil seated themselves,
the two bravos side by side and still seemingly
not a little perturbed, Lagardere opposite to
them and studying them closely, resting his chin
upon his hands.
</p>
<p>
"Ever since that night I have lived in Spain,
hunted for a while by Gonzague&#8217;s gang, until, gradually,
Gonzague&#8217;s gang ceased to exist."
</p>
<p>
"The thrust of Nevers," Cocardasse commented,
quietly.
</p>
<p>
Lagardere smiled sadly. "Exactly. I had only
one purpose in life&mdash;to avenge Nevers and to protect
Nevers&#8217;s child. I abandoned my captaincy of irregulars
when the late cardinal quarrelled with Spain.
I did not like the late cardinal, but he was a Frenchman,
and so was I. Since then I have lived as best
I could, from hand to mouth, but always the child
was safe, always the child was cared for, always the
child was in some obscure hands that were kind and
mild. Well, the child grew up, the beautiful child
dawned into a beautiful girl, and still I kept her to
myself, for I knew it was not safe to let Gonzague
know that she lived. But the girl is a woman now;
she is the age to inherit the territories of Nevers.
The law will shield her from the treason of Gonzague.
The king will protect the daughter of his friend."
</p>
<p>
The Norman shook his head, and the expression
of his face was very dubious. "Gonzague is a powerful
personage."
</p>
<p>
Cocardasse did not appear to be so much impressed
by the power of Gonzague, but then it must be remembered
that he came from Marseilles, while Passepoil
arrived from Calais, which is more impressed by
Paris. What the Gascon wanted to know was how
his old friend and one-time enemy had contrived to
appear so opportunely.
</p>
<p>
"How did you get here?" he asked.
</p>
<p>
Lagardere explained. "There was a gypsy lass
in Madrid of whom by chance Gabrielle had made a
friend. Poor girl, she could not have many friends.
One day this girl told us that she and her tribe were
going to Paris on some secret business of their own.
Here was an opportunity for the exiles to return,
unseen, to France. As gypsies, we travelled with
the gypsies. I have been a strolling player, and as
a strolling player I helped to pay my way. Before
we left Madrid I wrote you those letters. As a result
of all this delicate diplomacy, here I am, and
here you are."
</p>
<p>
Cocardasse still was puzzled. "But our letters
spoke of the service of Gonzague?"
</p>
<p>
Lagardere laughed as he answered the riddle.
"Because, dear dullards, I want you to enter the
service of Gonzague. If I return to France to right
a wrong, I know the risk I run and the blessing of
you two devils to help me."
</p>
<p>
Each of the two bravos extended his right hand.
"Any help we can give," protested Cocardasse&mdash;"is
yours," added Passepoil.
</p>
<p>
Lagardere clasped the extended hands confidently.
"I take you at your words. Gonzague is at the fair
yonder in attendance upon the king. You may get
a chance to approach him. He can hardly refuse
you his favor."
</p>
<p>
"Hardly," said Cocardasse, grimly, and&mdash;"hardly,"
echoed Passepoil, with a wry smile.
</p>
<p>
Lagardere rose to his feet. "Go now. I shall
find means to let you know of my whereabouts and
my purposes later. Till then&mdash;"
</p>
<p>
"Devotion!" cried Cocardasse.
</p>
<p>
"Discretion!" cried Passepoil, and each of the men
saluted Lagardere with a military salute. Then the
two bravos, linking arms, crossed the bridge together
and made for the fair, conversing as they went of the
wonderful chance that had brought Lagardere back
to Paris and their own good-fortune in having been
able to prove themselves innocent of complicity in
the murder of Nevers.
</p>
<p>
When they were gone, Lagardere walked slowly
up and down beneath the trees, reflecting deeply.
He had gained one point in the desperate game he
had set himself to play. He had found two adherents
upon whose hands, whose hearts, and whose
swords he could count with confidence, and he felt
that he had succeeded, in a measure, in planting adherents
of his own in the enemy&#8217;s camp. But he
had another point in his desperate game to win that
morning. He had written a letter, he had requested
a favor, he had made an appointment. Immediately
on arriving in the neighborhood of Paris he had
caused a letter to be despatched to the king&#8217;s majesty&mdash;not
to the king direct, indeed, but to the
king&#8217;s private secretary, whom Lagardere knew by
repute to be an honorable and loyal gentleman,
who could be, as he believed, relied upon, if he
credited the letter, to keep it as a secret between
himself and his royal master. It was a bold hazard,
although the letter was weighted with the talisman
of a name that must needs recall an ancient friendship.
Would that letter be answered? Would that
favor be granted? Would that appointment be
kept?
</p>
<p>
For some time Lagardere paced the grass thoughtfully;
for some time&mdash;perhaps for a quarter of an
hour&mdash;his solitude was undisturbed. At the end of
that time he emerged from the shadow of the trees,
and, standing at the foot of the bridge, surveyed the
road that led to Neuilly. What he saw upon the
road seemed to give him the greatest satisfaction.
Three gentlemen were walking together in the direction
of the Inn. One was a very dandy-like young
gentleman, very foppishly habited, who seemed to
skip through existence upon twinkling heels. Another
was a stiff, soldierly looking man of more than
middle age, whom Lagardere knew to be Captain
Bonnivet, of the Royal Guards. The third, who was
the first of the group, was a man who, though still in
the early prime of life, looked as if he were fretted
with the cares of many more years than were his lot.
He was a slender personage, with a long, pale face.
He was clad entirely in black, in emphasis of a mourning
mind, and as he walked he coughed from time to
time, and shivered and looked about him wistfully.
But at the same time he seemed to affect a gay
manner with his companions, as one that aired a
determination to be entertained. It was seventeen
years since Lagardere had seen the king, and he was
saddened at the change that the years had made in
him. He could only pray that those changing years
had wrought no alteration in the affection of Louis
of France for Louis of Nevers.

<h2>XV</h2>
<h3>THE KING&#8217;S WORD</h3>
</div>

<p>
In a moment Lagardere enveloped himself in his
gypsy&#8217;s cloak and flung himself on one of the
benches of the Inn, where he lay as if wrapped in the
heavy sleep which is the privilege of those that live
in the open air and follow the stars with their feet.
When the king, accompanied by Chavernay and followed
by Bonnivet, crossed the bridge and paused
before the Inn, nothing was to be noticed save the
huddle of gray cloth which represented some tired
wayfarer.
</p>
<p>
Louis of France looked about him curiously. "Is
this the Inn of the Three Graces?" he asked.
</p>
<p>
He even allowed himself to laugh a small laugh.
</p>
<p>
The Marquis of Chavernay smiled a faint smile.
"Yes, your majesty, and since I have been privileged
to behold two of its three attendant graces in the
flesh, and found them most commendable girls and
goddesses, I think, without indiscretion, I could hazard
a guess as to your reason for this visit."
</p>
<p>
The king looked at his impudent companion with the
complaisant good-humor which, since his much-talked-of
bereavement, he was prepared to extend to those
most fortunate among his courtiers who could succeed
in diverting his melancholy. He was familiar
with Chavernay&#8217;s impertinences, for Chavernay had
soon discovered that the witticisms which would
have gained the frown of the cardinal earned the
smiles of the king. "Truly," he said&mdash;"truly, I do
come for an assignation, but it is with no woman.
You boys think of nothing in the world but women."
</p>
<p>
Chavernay made the king a most sweeping reverence.
"Your majesty would, if your majesty
deigned to condescend so far, prove the most fatal
rival of your most amorous subject."
</p>
<p>
Since the death of the cardinal, Louis liked it to
be hinted that he was still the man of gallantry, irresistible
when he pleased. So he smiled as he caught
Chavernay&#8217;s ear and pinched it. "Imp, do you think
you lads are the only gallants, and that we old soldiers
must give way to you?"
</p>
<p>
Chavernay saluted him again. "You are our general,
your majesty&mdash;we win our battles in your name."
</p>
<p>
Louis laughed and then looked grave, smiled again
and then sighed. "My dear Chavernay, when you
are my age you will think that one pretty woman
is very like another pretty woman. But there is no
pretty woman in this case."
</p>
<p>
Chavernay made a still more ironical bow. "Your
majesty!" he said, with an air that implied: "Of
course I must appear to believe you, but in reality I
do not believe you at all." Chavernay was thinking
to himself of the adorable creatures whom he had seen
disappear within the walls of the Inn and the walls of
the caravan, and he drew his conclusions accordingly,
and drew them wrong. When the king answered
him, he answered, gravely, as one who objects to have
his word questioned even by a frivolous spirit like
Chavernay.
</p>
<p>
"I come here," he said, "in reply to a letter I received
two days ago&mdash;a letter which appeals to me
by a name which compels me to consider the appeal.
That is why I come here to-day. My correspondent
makes it a condition that I come alone. Take Bonnivet
with you. Keep within call, but out of sight."
</p>
<p>
Chavernay bowed very respectfully this time.
The newest friends of Louis of France knew that they
best pleased him by appearing to presume on his
good-nature, but even the lightest and liveliest of
them felt that there was a point beyond which he
must not venture to presume. Chavernay felt instinctively
that he had reached that point now, and
his manner was a pattern to presentable courtiers.
</p>
<p>
"Yes, your majesty," he said, and turned to Bonnivet,
and Bonnivet and he went over the bridge
and out of sight among a little clump of trees on the
roadside. From here they could see the king plainly
enough, and hear him if he chose to raise his voice
loud enough to call them, but here they were out
of ear-shot of any private conversation. That their
presence in the neighborhood was scarcely necessary
they were both well aware, for there were few conspiracies
against the king&#8217;s authority and no plots
against the king&#8217;s life, and if Louis of France had
chosen to go unattended his pompous, melancholy
person would have been in no danger.
</p>
<p>
Louis walked slowly to the little table in the arbor,
and, seating himself, took out a letter from his pocket
and read it thoughtfully over. Then he drew a watch
looped in diamonds from his pocket and looked at the
hour. As he did so the huddled, seeming sleeping
figure on the bench stiffened itself, sat up erect, and
cast off its cloak.
</p>
<p>
Lagardere rose and advanced towards the king.
"I am here," he said, in a firm, respectful voice.
</p>
<p>
Louis turned round and looked with curiosity
but without apprehension at the man who addressed
him, the man who was dressed like a gypsy, but who
clearly was no gypsy. "Are you the writer of this
letter?" he asked.
</p>
<p>
Lagardere saluted him with a graceful reverence.
"Yes, your Majesty. I know that you are the King
of France."
</p>
<p>
Louis slightly inclined his head. "I could not refuse
a summons that promised to tell me of Louis de
Nevers. Are you Lagardere?"
</p>
<p>
Lagardere made a gesture as of protest. "I am
his ambassador. Have I the privilege of an ambassador?"
</p>
<p>
The king frowned slightly. "What privilege?"
</p>
<p>
"Immunity if my mission displeases you," Lagardere
answered.
</p>
<p>
The king looked steadily at the seeming gypsy,
who returned his glance as steadily. "You are bold,
sir," he said.
</p>
<p>
Lagardere answered him, with composure. "I am
bold because I address Louis of France, who never
broke his word&mdash;Louis of France, who still holds dear
the memory of Louis of Nevers."
</p>
<p>
The king signed to him to continue. "Speak
freely. What do you know of Louis of Nevers?"
</p>
<p>
Lagardere went on: "Lagardere knows much. He
knows who killed Nevers. He knows where Nevers&#8217;s
child is. He can produce the child. He can denounce
the murderer."
</p>
<p>
"When?" asked the king, eagerly.
</p>
<p>
"To-morrow," Lagardere answered. Then he hastened
to add: "But he makes his conditions."
</p>
<p>
Louis frowned as Lagardere mentioned the word
"conditions," and asked: "What reward does he
want?"
</p>
<p>
Lagardere smiled at the question. "You do not
know Lagardere. He asks for a safe-conduct for
himself."
</p>
<p>
The king agreed. "He shall have it."
</p>
<p>
But Lagardere had more to ask. "He also wants
four invitations for the ball your majesty gives at
the Palais Royal to-morrow night."
</p>
<p>
Perhaps Lagardere showed himself something of a
courtier in this speech. The great Richelieu had bequeathed
to the little Louis his splendid dwelling-house,
and Louis was indeed giving a stately entertainment
there, avowedly in order to do honor to the
memory of him who had made so munificent a gift,
but in reality to prove to himself that he was master
where he had been slave, and that he could, if he
pleased, amuse himself to his heart&#8217;s content in the
house that had been the dwelling of his tyrant. What
Louis, always dissimulative, feigned to be an act of
gracious homage to dead generosity was in truth
an act of defiant and safe self-assertion. Perhaps
Lagardere guessed as much. Certainly he played
agreeably upon the king&#8217;s susceptibilities when he
gave to Richelieu&#8217;s bequest the name of Palais Royal,
which was still quite unfamiliar, instead of the name
of Palais Cardinal, which it had worn so long and
by which name almost every one still called it. Certainly
the king&#8217;s pale cheeks reddened with satisfaction
at the phrase; it assured him soothingly of
what he was pleased to consider his triumph. But
he allowed a slight expression of surprise to mingle
with his air of complacency, and Lagardere hastened
to give the reason for what was on the face of it a
sufficiently strange request.
</p>
<p>
"There, before the flower of the nobility of France,
Lagardere will denounce Nevers&#8217;s assassin and produce
Nevers&#8217;s child."
</p>
<p>
The king agreed again. "He shall have his wish.
Where shall the invitations be sent?"
</p>
<p>
Lagardere bowed low in acknowledgment of the
promise. "Sire," he said, "an emissary from Lagardere
will wait upon your secretary to-morrow morning
He will say that he has come for four invitations
promised by your majesty for to-morrow night,
and he will back his demand with the password
&#8217;Nevers.&#8217;"
</p>
<p>
The king bowed his head. "It shall be done as
you wish," he answered. "Is there anything more?"
he asked, and Lagardere replied: "This much more:
that your majesty speak nothing of this to any one
till midnight to-morrow."
</p>
<p>
The king agreed a third time. "Lagardere has
my word."
</p>
<p>
"Then," said Lagardere, "Lagardere will keep his
word."
</p>
<p>
Louis rose to his feet, and signed that the interview
was ended. "If he does, I am his friend for
life. But if he fail, let him never enter France
again, for on my word as a gentleman I will have
his head."
</p>
<p>
He saluted Lagardere slightly, and turned and
crossed the bridge. A few paces beyond it he was
joined by Chavernay and Bonnivet. The three
stood together for a few moments; then the king
and Bonnivet continued their journey towards Neuilly,
leaving Chavernay behind them, lingering in the
shade of the trees.
</p>

<a name='XVI_SHADOWS' id='XVI_SHADOWS'></a>
<h2>XVI</h2>
<h3>SHADOWS</h3>
</div>

<p>
Lagardere looked thoughtfully after the departing
monarch. "God save your majesty for
a gallant man," he murmured to himself. "Now
we may enter Paris in safety. Why, who is this?"
He was about to enter the Inn, when he suddenly
stopped and looked back sharply over the Neuilly
road. To his surprise he saw that the light-heeled
fop who had accompanied the king was retracing
his steps in the direction of the bridge.
</p>
<p>
Lagardere asked himself what this could mean.
Did the king suspect him? Was he sending this
delicate courtier to question him, to spy upon him?
He moved a little way across the stretch of common
land, and stood at the side of the caravan so that he
was concealed from any one crossing the bridge from
Neuilly. As a matter of fact, Chavernay&#8217;s return
had nothing whatever to do with the business which
had brought the king to the Inn of the Three Graces.
He had asked and gained permission to be free to
pursue a pastime of his own, and that pastime was
to try and learn something of the pretty lady whom
he had frightened into the seclusion of the Inn, a
pastime that he felt the freer to pursue now that
the king&#8217;s assurance that he had visited the Three
Graces for the sake of no woman.
</p>
<p>
So, dreaming of amorous possibilities, Chavernay
came daintily across the bridge, very young, very
self-confident, very impudent, very much enjoying
himself. As he neared the Inn he looked about him
nonchalantly, and, seeing that no one was in sight,
he stooped and caught up a pebble from the roadway
and flung it dexterously enough against the
window above the Inn porch. Then he slipped,
smiling mischievously, under the doorway of the
Inn, and waited upon events. In a moment the
window was opened, and Gabrielle looked out. "Is
that you, Henri?" she asked, softly.
</p>
<p>
Instantly Chavernay emerged from his hiding-place,
and stood bareheaded and bending almost
double before the beautiful girl. "It was I," he
said, with a manner of airy deference.
</p>
<p>
Gabrielle drew back a little. "You? Who are
you?" she asked, astonished.
</p>
<p>
Chavernay again made her a reverence. "Your
slave," he asserted.
</p>
<p>
Gabrielle remembered him now, and looked annoyed.
"Sir!" she said, angrily.
</p>
<p>
Chavernay saw her anger, but was not dismayed.
He was familiar with the feigned rages
of pretty country girls when it pleased great lords
to make love to them. "Listen to me," he pleaded.
"Ever since I first saw you I have adored
you."
</p>
<p>
He meant to say more, but he was not given the
time in which to say it, for Lagardere came forth
from his shelter beside the caravan and interrupted
him. At the sight of Lagardere, Gabrielle
gave a little cry and closed the window. Lagardere
advanced to Chavernay, who stared in astonishment
at the presumption of the gypsy fellow&mdash;a
gypsy fellow that carried a sword under his
mantle.
</p>
<p>
"That young girl is under my care, little gentleman,"
Lagardere said, mockingly.
</p>
<p>
But Chavernay was not easily to be dashed from
his habitual manner of genial insolence, and he
answered, as mockingly as Lagardere: "Then I tell
you what I told her: that I adore her."
</p>
<p>
Lagardere eyed him whimsically, grimly. He felt
disagreeably conscious of the contrast between himself
in his shabby habit and the gilded frippery of
this brilliant young insolence. He speculated with
melancholy as to the effect of this contrast on the
young girl that witnessed it. "You imp, you deserve
to be whipped!" he said, sharply.
</p>
<p>
Chavernay stared at him with eyes wide with astonishment,
and explained himself, haughtily: "I am
the Marquis de Chavernay, cousin of the Prince de
Gonzague."
</p>
<p>
Lagardere changed his phrase: "Then you come
of a bad house, and deserve to be hanged!"
</p>
<p>
In a second the little marquis dropped his daffing
manner. "If you were a gentleman, sir," he cried,
"and had a right to the sword you presume to carry,
I would make you back your words!"
</p>
<p>
Lagardere smiled ironically. "If it eases your
mind in any way," he said, quietly, "I can assure
you that I am a gentleman, although a poor one, and
have as good right to trail a sword as any kinsman
of the Prince de Gonzague." He paused, and then
added, not unpityingly: "I would rather beat you
than kill you."
</p>
<p>
Chavernay was scarcely to be appeased in this
fashion. Something in Lagardere&#8217;s carriage, something
in his voice, convinced the little marquis that
his enemy was speaking the truth, and that he was,
indeed, a gentleman. "Braggart!" he cried, and,
drawing his sword, he struck Lagardere across the
breast with the flat of his blade.
</p>
<p>
Lagardere was quite unmoved by the affront.
Leisurely he drew his sword and leisurely fell into
position, saying, "Very well, then."
</p>
<p>
The swords engaged for a moment&mdash;only for a moment.
Then, to the surprise and rage of Chavernay,
his hand and his sword parted company, and the
sword, a glittering line of steel, leaped into the air
and fell to earth many feet away from him. Even
as this happened, Gabrielle, who had been watching
with horror the quarrel from behind her curtains,
came running down the Inn stairs and darted through
the door into the open.
</p>
<p>
She turned to Lagardere, appealing: "Do not hurt
him, Henri; he is but a child."
</p>
<p>
The little marquis frowned. He disliked to be
regarded as a pitiable juvenile. "If the gentleman
will return me my sword," he said, "I will not lose
it again so lightly."
</p>
<p>
Lagardere looked at him with kind-hearted compassion.
"If I returned you your sword twenty
times," he said, "its fate would be twenty times
the same. Take your sword and use it hereafter to
defend women, not to insult them."
</p>
<p>
While he was speaking he had stepped to where
Chavernay&#8217;s blade lay on the sward, and had picked
it up, and now, as he made an end of speaking, he
handed Chavernay the rapier. Chavernay took it,
and sent it home in its sheath half defiantly. "Fair
lady, I ask your pardon," he said, bowing very
reverentially to Gabrielle. "Let me call myself
ever your servant." He turned and gave Lagardere
a salutation that was more hostile than amiable, and
then recrossed the bridge in his airiest manner as one
that is a lord of fortune. Lagardere stood silent,
almost gloomy, looking at the ground. Gabrielle
regarded him for a moment timidly, and then, advancing,
softly placed a hand upon his shoulder.
</p>
<p>
"You are not angry with me?" she whispered.
</p>
<p>
Lagardere turned to her and forced himself to
smile cheerfully. "Angry&mdash;with you? How could
that be possible?" He was silent for a moment, then
he asked: "Do you know that gentleman?"
</p>
<p>
Gabrielle shook her head. "I saw him for the first
time to-day, not very long ago, when I was speaking
to Flora. I had come out for a moment when she
called to me, and he came over the bridge and took
us unawares."
</p>
<p>
Lagardere looked at her thoughtfully. "Could
you love such a man as he?" he asked, gravely. "He
is young, he is brave, he is witty; he might well win
a girl&#8217;s heart."
</p>
<p>
Gabrielle returned Lagardere&#8217;s earnest look with a
look of surprise. "He is a noble. I am a poor girl."
</p>
<p>
Lagardere smiled wistfully. "How if you were no
longer to be a poor girl, Gabrielle? How if this visit
to Paris were to change our fortunes?"
</p>
<p>
Gabrielle looked at him curiously. "Why have we
come to Paris, Henri? I thought there was danger
in Paris?"
</p>
<p>
"There was danger in Paris," Lagardere said, slowly&mdash;"grave
danger. But I have seen a great man,
and the danger has vanished, and you and I are coming
to the end of our pilgrimage."
</p>
<p>
"The end of our pilgrimage?" echoed Gabrielle.
"What is going to happen to us?"
</p>
<p>
"Wonderful things," Lagardere said, lightly&mdash;"beautiful
things. You shall know all about them
soon enough." To himself he whispered: "Too soon
for me." Then he addressed the girl again, blithely:
"When I took you to Madrid you saw the color of
the court, you heard the music of festivals. Did you
not feel that you were made for such a life?"
</p>
<p>
Gabrielle answered instantly: "Yes, for that life&mdash;or
any life&mdash;with you."
</p>
<p>
Lagardere protested: "Ah, but without me."
</p>
<p>
Gabrielle&#8217;s graceful being seemed to stiffen a little,
and her words gave an absolute decision: "Nothing
without you, Henri."
</p>
<p>
Lagardere seemed to tempt the girl with his next
speech: "Those women you saw had palaces, had
noble kinsfolk, had mothers&mdash;"
</p>
<p>
Gabrielle was not to be tempted from her faith.
"A mother is the only treasure I envy them," she
said, firmly.
</p>
<p>
Lagardere looked at her strangely, and again questioned
her. "But suppose you had a mother, and
suppose you had to choose between that mother and
me?"
</p>
<p>
For a moment Gabrielle paused. The question
seemed to have a distressing effect upon her. She
echoed his last words: "Between my mother and
you." Then she paused, and her lips trembled, but
she spoke very steadily: "Henri, you are the first
in the world for me."
</p>
<p>
Lagardere sighed. "You have never known a
mother, but there are graver rivals to a friendship
such as ours than a mother&#8217;s love."
</p>
<p>
"What rivals can there be to our friendship?"
Gabrielle asked.
</p>
<p>
Lagardere answered her sadly enough, though he
seemed to smile: "A girl&#8217;s love for a boy, a maid&#8217;s
love for a man. That pretty gentleman who was
here but now, and swore he adored you&mdash;if you
were noble, could you love such a man as he?"
</p>
<p>
Gabrielle began to laugh, as if all the agitations of
the past instants had been dissipated into nothingness
by the jest of such a question. "I swear to you,
Henri," she said, softly, "that the man I could love
would not be at all like Monsieur de Chavernay."
</p>
<p>
In spite of himself, Lagardere gave a sigh of relief.
It was something, at least, to know whom Gabrielle
de Nevers could not love. He essayed to laugh, too.
</p>
<p>
"What would he be like," he asked&mdash;"the wonder
whom you would consent to love?"
</p>
<p>
He spoke very merrily, but it racked his heart
to speak thus lightly of the love of Gabrielle. He
wished that he were a little boy again, that he might
hide behind some tree and cry out his grief in bitter
tears. But being, as he reminded himself, a weather-beaten
soldier of fortune, it was his duty to screen
his misery with a grin and to salute his doom with
amusement. As for Gabrielle, she came a little nearer
to Lagardere, and her eyes were shining very
brightly, and her lips trembled a little, and she
seemed a little pale in the clear air.
</p>
<p>
"I will try to paint you a picture," she said, hesitatingly,
"of the man I"&mdash;she paused for a second,
and then continued, hurriedly&mdash;"of the man I could
love. He would be about your height, as I should
think, to the very littlest of an inch; and he would
be built as you are built, Henri; and his hair would
be of your color, and his eyes would have your fire;
and his voice would have the sound of your voice,
the sweetest sound in the world; and the sweetest
sound of that most sweet voice would be when it
whispered to me that it loved me."
</p>
<p>
Lagardere looked at her with haggard, happy
eyes. He could not misunderstand, and he was
happy; he dared not understand, and he was sad.
</p>
<p>
"Gabrielle," he said, softly, "when you were a
little maid I used to tell you tales to entertain you.
Will you let me spin you a fable now?"
</p>
<p>
The girl said nothing; only she nodded, and she
looked at him very fixedly. Lagardere went on:
</p>
<p>
"There was once a man, a soldier of fortune, an
adventurous rogue, into whose hands a jesting destiny
confided a great trust. That trust was the life
of a child, of a girl, of a woman, whom it was his
glory to defend for a while with his sword against
many enemies."
</p>
<p>
"I think he defended her very well," Gabrielle interrupted,
gently. Lagardere held up a warning finger.
</p>
<p>
"Hush," he said. "What I am speaking of took
place ages ago, when the world was ever so much
younger, in the days of Charlemagne and Cæsar and
Achilles and other great princes long since withered,
so you can know nothing at all about it. But this
rogue of my story had a sacred duty to fulfil. He
had to restore to this charge, this ward of his, the
name, the greatness, that had been stolen from her.
It was his mission to give her back the gifts which
had been filched from her by treason. For seventeen
years he had lived for this purpose, and only for this
purpose, crushing all other thoughts, all other hopes,
all other dreams. What would you say of such a
man, so sternly dedicated to so great a faith, if he
were to prove false to his trust, and to allow his own
mad passion to blind him to the light of loyalty, to
deafen him to the call of honor?"
</p>
<p>
He was looking away from her as he spoke, but the
girl came close to him and caught his hands, and made
him turn his face to her, and each saw that the other&#8217;s
eyes were wet. Gabrielle spoke steadily, eagerly:
</p>
<p>
"You say that what you speak of happened very
long ago. But we are to-day as those were yesterday,
and if I were the maid of your tale I would say
to the man that love is the best thing a true man can
give to a true woman, and that a woman who wore
my body could lose no wealth, no kingdom, to compare
with the rich treasure of her lover&#8217;s heart."
</p>
<p>
There was no mistaking the meaning of the girl,
the meaning ringing in her words, shining in her eyes,
appealing in her out-stretched arms. To Lagardere
it seemed as if the kingdom of the world were offered
to him. He had but to keep silence, and his heart&#8217;s
desire was his. But he remembered the night in the
moat of Caylus, he remembered the purpose of long
years, he remembered his duty, he remembered his
honor, and he grappled with the dragon of passion,
with the dragon of desire. Very calmly he touched
for a moment, with caressing hand, the hair of Gabrielle.
Very quietly he spoke.
</p>
<p>
"We are taking my fairy tale too gravely," he
said. "It all happened long ago, and has nothing
to do with us. Our story is very different, and our
story is coming to a wonderful conclusion. This
day is your last day of doubt and ignorance, of solitude
and poverty." He turned a little away from
her and murmured to himself: "It is also my last
day of youth and joy and hope."
</p>
<p>
Gabrielle pressed her hands against her breasts
for a moment, like one in great dismay. The tears
welled into her eyes. Then she gave a little moan
of wonder and protest, and sprang towards him with
out-stretched hands. "Do you not understand?" she
cried. "Henri, Henri, I love you."
</p>
<p>
Lagardere grasped the out-stretched hands, and
in another moment would have caught the girl in
his arms, but a dry, crackling laugh arrested him.
Gently restraining Gabrielle&#8217;s advance, he turned
his head and saw standing upon the bridge surveying
him and Gabrielle a sinister figure. It was
Æsop, returning from his stroll with Monsieur Peyrolles,
who had paused on the bridge in cynical
amusement of what he conceived to be a lovers&#8217;
meeting between countryman and countrymaid, but
whose face now flushed with a sudden interest as he
recognized the face of the man in the gypsy habit.
</p>
<p>
Lagardere turned again to Gabrielle, and his face
was calm and smiling. "Go in-doors," he said, pleasantly,
"I will join you by-and-by."
</p>
<p>
Gabrielle, in her turn, had glanced at the sinister
figure on the bridge, and, seeing the malevolence of
its attitude, of its expression, had drawn back with
a faint cry. "Henri," she said&mdash;"Henri, who is that
watching us? He looks so evil."
</p>
<p>
Lagardere had recognized Æsop as instantly as
Æsop had recognized Lagardere. Æsop now came
slowly towards them, addressing them mockingly:
"Do not let me disturb you. Life is brief, but love
is briefer."
</p>
<p>
Lagardere again commanded Gabrielle: "Go in,
child, at once."
</p>
<p>
"Are you in danger?" Gabrielle asked, fearfully.
</p>
<p>
Lagardere shook his head and repeated his command:
"No. Go in at once. Wait in your room
until I come for you."
</p>
<p>
Æsop looked at him with raised eyebrows and a
wicked grin. "Why banish the lady? She might
find my tale entertaining."
</p>
<p>
At an imperative signal from Lagardere, Gabrielle
entered the Inn. Lagardere then advanced towards
Æsop, who watched him with folded arms and his
familiar malevolent smile. When they were quite
close, Æsop greeted Lagardere:
</p>
<p>
"So the rat has come to the trap at last. Lagardere
in Paris&mdash;ha, ha!"
</p>
<p>
Lagardere looked at him ponderingly. "The
thought amuses you."
</p>
<p>
Æsop&#8217;s grin deepened. "Very much. Before nightfall
you will be in prison."
</p>
<p>
Lagardere seemed to deny him. "I think not.
You carry a sword and can use it. You shall fight
for your life, like your fellow-assassins."
</p>
<p>
Æsop looked about him. "I have but to raise
my voice. There must be people within call even in
this sleepy neighborhood."
</p>
<p>
Lagardere still smiled, and the smile was still provocative.
"But if you raise your voice I shall be reluctantly
compelled to stab you where you stand.
Ah, coward, can you only fight in the dark when
you are nine to one?"
</p>
<p>
Æsop gave his hilt a hitch. "You will serve my
master&#8217;s turn as well dead as alive. I wear the best
sword in the world, and it longs for your life."
</p>
<p>
Lagardere pointed to the tranquil little Inn. "Behind
yonder Inn there is a garden. To-day, when all
the world is at the fair, that garden is as lonely as a
cemetery. At the foot of the garden runs the river,
a ready grave for the one who falls. There we can
fight in quiet to our heart&#8217;s content."
</p>
<p>
Æsop glared at Lagardere with a look of triumphant
hatred. "I mean to kill you, Lagardere!"
he said, and the tone of his voice was surety of his
intention and his belief in his power to carry it out.
</p>
<p>
Lagardere only laughed as lightly as before. "I
mean to kill you, Master Æsop. I have waited a
long time for the pleasure of seeing you again."
</p>
<p>
Then the pair passed into the quiet Inn and out of
the quiet Inn into the quiet Inn&#8217;s quiet garden, and
down the quiet garden to a quiet space hard by the
quiet river.
</p>
<hr class='major' />

<h2>XVII</h2>
<h3>IN THE GARDEN</h3>
</div>

<p>
Beyond the Inn there ran, or rather rambled,
a long garden, the more neglected part of which
was grown with flowers, while the better-attended
portion was devoted to the cultivation of vegetables.
Where the garden ceased a little orchard of
apple-trees, pear-trees, and plum-trees began, and
this orchard was followed by a small open space of
grassed land which joined the river. Here a diminutive
landing-stage had been built, which was now
crazy enough with age and dilapidation, and attached
to this stage were a couple of ancient rowing-boats,
against whose gaunt ribs the ripples lapped.
Sometimes this garden and orchard had their visitors:
the landlord and his friends would often smoke their
pipes and drink their wine under the shade of the
trees, and even passing clients would occasionally
indulge themselves with the privilege of a stroll in
the untidy garden. But to-day the place was quite
deserted&mdash;as desolate as a garden in a dream.
Every one who could go had gone to the fair, and
those travellers who paused to drink in passing
took their liquor quickly and hurried on to share
in the fair&#8217;s festivity. The landlord was kept busy
enough attending to those passers-by in the early
part of the day, and, now that the stream had ceased
and custom slackened, he was glad enough to take
his ease in-doors and leave his garden to its loneliness.
</p>
<p>
When, therefore, Lagardere and Æsop entered the
garden they found it as quiet and as uninhabited as
any pair of swordsmen could desire. They walked
in silence along the path between the flowers and
the vegetables, Lagardere only pausing for a moment
to pluck a wild rose which he proposed in the serenity
of his confidence to present to Gabrielle, and while
he paused Æsop eyed him maliciously and amused
himself by kicking with his heel at a turnip and
hacking it into fragments. Lagardere put his flower
into the lapel of his coat, and the pair resumed their
silent progress through the orchard till they came
to a halt upon the river-bank.
</p>
<p>
Lagardere looked about him and seemed pleased
with what he saw. There was no one in sight, either
hard by or upon the opposite bank of the river, and
he felt that it might be taken for granted that there
was no one within hearing. He turned to Æsop and
addressed him, very pleasantly: "This, I think, will
serve our purpose as well as any place in the world."
</p>
<p>
Æsop grinned malignly. "It would suit my purpose,"
he said, "to get you out of the way in any
place in the world."
</p>
<p>
Lagardere laughed softly and shook his head.
"One or other of us has to be got out of the way," he
said, quietly, "but I think, Master Æsop, that I am
not the man. I have been waiting a long time for
this chance; but I always felt sure that the time
would bring the chance, and I mean to make an end
of you."
</p>
<p>
Æsop scowled. "You talk very big, Little Parisian,"
he said, "but you will find that in me you deal
with a fellow of another temper to those poor hirelings
you have been lucky enough to kill. They were common
rogues enough, that handled their swords like
broom-handles. I was always a master, and my
skill has grown more perfect since we last met at
Caylus. I think you will regret this meeting, Captain
Lagardere."
</p>
<p>
Now, Lagardere had been listening very patiently
while Æsop spoke, and while he listened a thought
came into his mind which at first seemed too fantastic
for consideration, but which grew more tempting
and more entertainable with every second. To thrust
Æsop from his path was one thing, and a thing that
must be done if Lagardere&#8217;s life-purposes were to
be accomplished. But to get rid of Æsop and yet
to use him&mdash;at once to obliterate him and yet to
recreate him, so that he should prove the most deadly
enemy of the base cause that he was paid to serve&mdash;here
was a scheme, a dream, that if it could be made
a reality would be fruitful of good uses. It was therefore
with a strange smile that he listened while Æsop
menaced him with regret for the meeting, and it was
with a strange smile that he spoke:
</p>
<p>
"I do not think so," he answered, maturing his
plan even while he talked, and finding it the more
feasible and the more pleasing. "You are a haggard
rascal, Master Æsop, and the world should have no
use for you. I believe that by what I am about to
do I shall render the world and France and myself
a service. You are nothing more than a rabid wild
beast, and it is well to be quit of you." As he spoke
he drew his sword and came on guard.
</p>
<p>
Something in the composed manner and the mocking
speech of Lagardere seemed to bid Æsop pause.
He let his weapon remain in its sheath and began
to parley.
</p>
<p>
"Come, come, Captain Lagardere," he began, "is
it necessary, after all, that we should quarrel? You
have got Nevers&#8217;s girl&mdash;there is no denying that&mdash;but
we do not want her. We have a girl of our own.
Now I know well enough, for I have not studied love
books and read love books for nothing," and he grinned
hideously as he spoke, "that you are in love with
the girl you carry about with you. Well and good.
How if we call a truce, make a peace? You shall keep
your girl, and do as you please with her; we will produce
our girl, and do as we please with her. You
shall have as much money as you want, I can promise
that for the Prince of Gonzague, and you can live in
Madrid or where you please with your pretty minion.
Make a bargain, man, and shake hands on it."
</p>
<p>
Lagardere eyed the hunchback with something of
the compassion and curiosity of a surgeon about to
deal with an ugly case. He saw now his enemy&#8217;s
hand and the strength of his enemy&#8217;s cards and the
cleverness of his enemy&#8217;s plan, and was not in the
least abashed by its audacity or his own isolation.
</p>
<p>
"Master Æsop," he said, briefly, "if it ever came
to pass that I should find myself making terms or
shaking hands with such as you, or the knave that
uses you for his base purpose, I should very swiftly
go and hang myself, I should be so ashamed of my
own bad company. We have talked long enough;
it is time for action." He saluted quickly as he
spoke, according to the code of the fencing-schools.
</p>
<p>
And Æsop, in answer to the challenge, drew his
own sword and answered the salutation. "Gallant
captain," he sneered, "I have been in training for
this chance these many years, and I think I will
teach you to weep for your heroics." As he spoke
he came on guard, and the blades met.
</p>
<p>
The place that had been chosen for the combat
was suitable enough, quite apart from its solitude.
The morning air was clear and even; the sun&#8217;s height
caused no diverting rays to disturb either adversary;
the grass was smooth and supple to the feet; there
was ample ground to break in all directions.
</p>
<p>
The moment that Lagardere&#8217;s steel touched that
of Æsop&#8217;s, he knew that Æsop&#8217;s boast had not been
made in vain. Though it was a long time now since
that afternoon in the frontier Inn when he and
Æsop had joined blades before, he remembered the
time well enough to appreciate the difference between
the sword he then encountered and the sword he
encountered now. Clearly Æsop had spoken the
truth when he had talked of his daily practice and his
steady advance towards perfection. But, and Lagardere
smiled as he remembered this, Æsop had forgotten
or overlooked the possibility that Lagardere&#8217;s own
sword-play would improve with time&mdash;that Lagardere&#8217;s
own sword-play was little likely to rust for
lack of usage.
</p>
<p>
The few minutes that followed upon the encounter
of the hostile steels were minutes of sheer enjoyment
to Lagardere. Æsop was a worthy antagonist, that
he frankly admitted from the first, and he wished, as
he fought, that he could divide his personality and
admire, as a spectator, the passage at arms between
two such champions. Of the result, from the first,
Lagardere had not the slightest doubt. He was honestly
convinced, by his simple logic of steel, that it was
his mission to avenge Nevers and to expiate his murder.
He was, as it were, a kind of seventeenth century
crusader, with a sealed and sacred mission to follow;
and while, as a stout-hearted and honest soldier of fortune,
he had no more hesitation about killing a venomous
thing like Æsop than he would have had about
killing a snake, he was in this special instance exulted
by the belief that in killing one of the men of the
moat of Caylus his sword was the sword of justice,
his sword was the sword of God.
</p>
<p>
If, therefore, it was soon plain to him that the boast
of the hunchback was true enough, and that his skill
with his weapon had greatly bettered in the years
that had elapsed since their previous encounter, Lagardere
was rejoiced to find it so, as it gave a greater
difficulty and a greater honor to his achievement. It
was clear, too, from the expression on Æsop&#8217;s face,
after the first few instants of the engagement, that
he was made aware that his skill was not as the skill
of Lagardere. He fought desperately, and yet warily,
knowing that he was fighting for his life, and trying
without success every cunning trick that he had
learned in the fencing-schools of Spain. The thrust
of Nevers he did not attempt, for of that he knew
Lagardere commanded the parry, but there were
other thrusts on which he relied to gain the victory,
and each of these he tried in succession, only to be
baffled by Lagardere&#8217;s instinctive steel.
</p>
<p>
Lagardere, watching him while they fought, hated
his adversary for his own sake apart from his complicity
in the crime of Caylus. Æsop was the incarnation
of everything that was detestable in the eyes
of a man like Lagardere. A splendid swordsman, his
sword was always lightly sold to evil causes. He
prostituted the noble weapon that Lagardere idolized
to the service of the assassin, the advantage of the
bully, and the revenge of the coward. He would have
felt no scruple about slaying him, even if Æsop had
not been, as now he was, a dangerous and unexpected
enemy in his path.
</p>
<p>
Æsop, unable to make Lagardere break ground,
and unable to get within Lagardere&#8217;s guard, now began
to taunt his antagonist savagely, calling him a
child-stealer and a woman-wronger, with other foul
terms of abuse that rolled glibly from his lips in the
ugliness of his rage and fear.
</p>
<p>
Lagardere listened with his quiet smile, and when
the hunchback made a pause he answered him with
scornful good-humor. "You waste your breath, Master
Æsop," he said, "and you should be saving it
for your prayers, if you know any, or for your fighting
wind, if there is nothing of salvation in you. You
are a very base knave. I do not think you ever did
an honest, a kindly, or a generous deed in your life.
I know that you have done many vile things, and
would do more if time were given to you; but the
time is denied, Master Æsop, and yet you may serve
a good cause in your death."
</p>
<p>
Even as he spoke Lagardere&#8217;s tranquillity of defence
suddenly changed into rapidity of attack. His
blade leaped forward, made sudden swift movements
which the bravo strove in vain to parry, and then
Æsop dropped his sword and fell heavily upon the
grass. He was dead, dead of the thrust in the face,
exactly between the eyes, the thrust of Nevers.
</p>
<p>
Lagardere leaned over his dead enemy and smiled.
His account against the assassins of Caylus was being
slowly paid; but never had any item of that account
been annulled with less regret. The others&mdash;Staupitz,
Saldagno, Pinto, and the rest&mdash;had been ruffianly
creatures enough, but there was a kind of honesty, a
measure of courage in their ruffianism. They were,
at least some of them, good-hearted in their way, true
to their comrades and their leaders; but of the ignoble
wretch that now lay a huddle of black at his feet,
Lagardere knew nothing that was not loathsome, and
he knew much of Master Æsop.
</p>
<p>
Lagardere stooped and gathered a handful of grass,
wiped his sword and sheathed it.
</p>
<p>
"Yes," he said, apostrophizing the dead body, "you
shall serve a good cause now, Master Æsop, if you
have never served a good cause yet."
</p>
<p>
He looked anxiously about him as he spoke to make
sure that the solitude was still undisturbed. There
was not a human being within sight on either bank
of the river. This quiet, this isolation, were very welcome
to his temper just then, for the purpose that
had come into Lagardere&#8217;s mind at the commencement
of the combat had matured, had ripened during
its course into a feasible plan. It had its risks, but
what did that matter in an enterprise that was all
risk; and if it succeeded, as, thanks to its very daring,
it might succeed, it promised a magnificent reward.
That it involved the despoiling of a dead body in no
way harassed Lagardere. He was never one to let
himself be squeamish over trifles where a great cause
was at stake, and, though much that was inevitable
to the success of his scheme was repellent to him, he
choked down his disgust and faced his duty with a
smile. Quickly he dragged the body of his dead
enemy into the shelter and seclusion of the orchard-trees.
There, rolling Æsop on his face, he proceeded
nimbly and dexterously to strip his clothes from his
body. Soon the black coat, black vest, black breeches,
black stockings, black boots, and black hat lay in a
pile of sable raiment on the orchard grass. As he garnered
his spoil, a little book dropped from the pocket
of the black coat and lay upon the grass. Lagardere
picked it up and opened it with a look of curiosity
that speedily changed to one of aversion, for the book
was a copy in Italian of the <i>Luxurious Sonnets</i> of
Messer Pietro Arentino, which Lagardere, who knew
Italian, found at a glance to be in no way to his taste,
and the little book had pictures in it which pleased
him still less. With a grunt of disgust at this strange
proof of the dead man&#8217;s taste in literature, Lagardere
stepped to the edge of the orchard, and, holding the
volume in his finger and thumb, pitched it over the
open space into the river, where it sank. Having
thus easily got rid of the book, Lagardere began to cast
about him for some way to dispose of the body.
</p>
<p>
The boats that lay alongside of the little landing-stage
caught his eye. Lifting Master Æsop&#8217;s corpse
from the ground, he trailed it to the crazy structure,
and placed it in the oldest and most ramshackle of the
two weather-worn vessels. After untying the rope
that fastened the boat to its wharf, Lagardere caught
up a boat-hook that lay hard by, and, raising it as if
it were a spear, he drove it with all his strength
against the bottom of the boat and knocked a ragged
hole in its rotting timbers. Then, with a vigorous
push, he sent the boat out upon the smooth, swift
river.
</p>
<p>
The vigor of its impetus carried the boat nearly out
to the middle of the stream before the river could
take advantage of the leak. Then, in a few minutes,
Lagardere saw the strangely burdened craft slowly
sink and finally settle beneath the surface of the
stream.
</p>
<p>
When the boat and its burden were out of sight, and
the water ran as smoothly as if it were troubled with
no such secret, Lagardere turned, and, gathering up
the garments of his antagonist as a Homeric hero
would have collected his fallen enemy&#8217;s armor, rolled
them into as small a bundle as possible, and, putting
them under his arm, made his way cautiously back
to the Inn.
</p>
<p>
He gained its shelter unperceived. Unperceived
and noiselessly he ascended the stairs which led to
his room, and, opening the door, flung his bundle upon
the ground. He then closed the door again, and,
going a little farther down the corridor, knocked at
an adjoining door, which immediately opened, and
Gabrielle stood before him looking pale and anxious.
Lagardere smiled cheerfully at her, and, taking from
his coat the white rose which he had plucked in the
garden, offered it to her.
</p>
<p>
The girl caught it and pressed it to her lips, and
then asked, eagerly: "The man&mdash;where is the man?
What has become of him?"
</p>
<p>
Lagardere affected an air of surprise, and then,
with the manner of one who thought the matter of
no importance, answered her: "You mean my friend
in black who spoke to me just now?"
</p>
<p>
The girl nodded. "Yes," she said, "he seemed
evil, he seemed dangerous."
</p>
<p>
Lagardere smiled reassuringly. "Evil he may be,"
he said, "but not dangerous&mdash;no, not dangerous. Indeed,
I am inclined to think he will be more useful to
us than otherwise."
</p>
<p>
"But he seemed to threaten you," the girl protested.
</p>
<p>
Lagardere admitted the fact. "He was a little
threatening at first," he agreed, "but I have managed
to pacify him, and he will not trouble us any
more."
</p>
<p>
He took the girl&#8217;s cold hand and kissed it reverentially.
"Gabrielle," he said, "we go to Paris to-day,
but till I come for you and tell you it is time for us
to depart I want you to remain in this chamber.
You will do this for me, will you not?"
</p>
<p>
"I will always do whatever you wish," the girl answered,
and her eyes filled with tears.
</p>
<p>
Lagardere was filled with the longing to clasp her
in his arms, but he restrained himself, again kissed
her hand with the same air of tender devotion, and
motioned to her to enter her room. When she had
closed the door he returned to his own room, and
there, with amazing swiftness, divested himself of
his outer garments and substituted for them those
of the dead Æsop.
</p>
<p>
Producing a small box from a battered portmantle
that stood in a corner, he produced certain pigments
from it, and, facing a cracked fragment of unframed
looking-glass that served for a mirror, proceeded with
the skill of an experienced actor to make certain
changes in his appearance.
</p>
<p>
His curiously mobile face he distorted at once into
an admirable likeness to the hunchback, and then,
this initial likeness thus acquired, he heightened and
intensified it by few but skilful strokes of coloring matter.
Then he dexterously rearranged his hair to resemble
the hunchback&#8217;s dishevelled locks, compelling
its curls to fall about his transformed face and shade
it. Finally he surmounted all with the hunchback&#8217;s
hat, placed well forward on his forehead. He gave a
smile of satisfaction at the result of his handiwork,
and the smile was the malign smile of Æsop.
</p>
<p>
"That is good enough," he murmured, "to deceive
a short-sighted fellow like Peyrolles, and as for his
Highness of Gonzague, he has not seen me for so
many years that there will be no difficulty with him."
</p>
<p>
He glanced at his new raiment with an expression
of distaste. "When I get to Paris," he mused, "I
will shift these habiliments. It is all very well to
play the bird of prey, but it is somewhat unpleasant
to wear the bird&#8217;s own feathers."

<h2>XVIII</h2>
<h3>THE FACTION OF GONZAGUE</h3>
</div>

<p>
A little later in the day a company of joyous
gentlemen made their way from the fair of
Neuilly and came to a halt opposite the tavern whose
green arbors seemed inviting enough after the heat
of the dusty road. All of the company were richly
dressed, most of the company were young&mdash;the joyous
satellites of the central figure of the party. This
was a tall, graceful Italianate man, who carried his
fifty years with the grace and ease of thirty. He had
a handsome face; those that admired him, and they
were many, said there was no handsomer man at the
court of the king than the king&#8217;s familiar friend
Louis de Gonzague. A man of the hour and a man
of the world, Gonzague delighted to shine almost
unrivalled and quite unsurpassed in the splendid
court which the cardinal had permitted the king to
gather about him. Something of a statesman and
much of a scholar, Gonzague delighted to be the patron
of the arts, and to lend, indirectly, indeed, but no
less efficaciously, his counsels to the service of the
cardinal during the cardinal&#8217;s lifetime, and to the
king now that the cardinal was gone. A man of
pleasure, Gonzague was careful to enjoy all the delights
that a society which found its chief occupation
in the pursuit of amusement afforded. Even the
youngest cavalier in Paris or Versailles would have
regretted to find himself in rivalry with Gonzague
for the favors of the fair. But in his pleasures, as in
his policy, Gonzague was always discreet, reserved,
even slightly mysterious, and though rumor had linked
his name time and time again with the names of
such gracious ladies as the cardinal had permitted to
illuminate the court of the king, Gonzague had always
been far too cautious, or too indifferent, to drift
into anything that could in the least resemble an enduring
entanglement. Indeed, there was an element
of the Oriental in his tastes, which led him rather to
find his entertainment in such light love as came and
went by the back ways of palaces or could be sequestered
in cheerful little country villas remote from
curious eyes. This, however, was a matter of gossip,
rumor, speculation. What was certainly known about
Louis de Gonzague was that he delighted always to be
surrounded by young gentlemen of blood and spirit,
with whom his exquisite affability seemed at once to
put him on a footing of equal age, and whose devotion
to himself, his person, and his purposes he was always
careful to acquire by a lavish generosity and that powerful
patronage which his former friendship with the
cardinal and his present influence over the king allowed
him to extend.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps the most remarkable proof of Gonzague&#8217;s
astuteness, of Gonzague&#8217;s suppleness, was afforded by
the manner in which he had succeeded in holding
the favor of the great cardinal through all the long
years of Richelieu&#8217;s triumph, and yet at the same
time in retaining so completely the friendship of the
king. When the cardinal died, and many gentlemen
that served the Red Robe found themselves no longer
in esteem, Gonzague passed at once into the circle of
the king&#8217;s most intimate friends. Gonzague, as the
comrade of a ruling potentate, proved himself a master
of all arts that might amuse a melancholic sovereign
newly redeemed from an age-long tutelage, and
eager to sate those many long-restrained pleasures
that he was at last free to command. Gonzague&#8217;s
ambition appeared to be to play the Petronius part,
to be the Arbiter of Elegancies to a newly liberated
king and a newly quickened court.
</p>
<p>
Very wisely Gonzague had never made himself a
politician. He had always allowed himself to appear
as one that was gracefully detached, by his Italianate
condition, from pledge to any party issues, and so in
his suave, affable fashion he went his way, liked by
all men who knew him slightly, counted on by the
few men who believed they knew him well, and hugely
admired by that vast congregation of starers and
gapers who passionately display their approval of an
urbane, almost an austere, profligacy.
</p>
<p>
In the long years in which Gonzague had contrived
to establish for himself the enviable reputation of
the ideal of high gentlehood, he had very quietly and
cautiously formed, as it were, a kind of court within
a court&mdash;a court that was carefully formed for the
faithful service of his interests. He managed, by
dexterously conferring obligations of one kind or another,
to bind his adherents to him by ties as strong
as the ties of kinship, by ties stronger than the ties
of allegiance to an unsettled state and a shadowy
idea of justice. There was a Gonzague party among
the aristocracy of the hour, and a very strong party
it promised to be, and very ably guided to further
his own ends by the courteous, so seeming amiable
gentleman who was its head.
</p>
<p>
About him at this moment were grouped some of
the joyous members of that jovial sodality. There
was Navailles, the brisk, the dissolute, the witty, always
ready to risk everything, including honor, for
a cast of the dice, for a kiss, for a pleasure or a revenge.
There was Nocé, pleasure-loving, pleasure-giving,
always good-tempered, always good-humored,
always serenely confident that the world as it existed
was made chiefly for his amusement and the amusement
of his friends. There was Taranne, a darker
spirit, as ready as the rest of the fellowship to take the
wine of life from the cup of joy in the hands of the
dancing-girl, but a less genial drinker, a less cheerful
and perhaps more greedy lover and feaster, as one
who dimly and imperfectly appreciates that the conditions
of things about him might not be destined to
endure forever, and was, therefore, resolved to get as
much of his share of the spoil of the sport while it
lasted as any bandit of them all. There, too, was
Oriol, the fat country gentleman, at once the richest
and most foolish of the company. There, too, was
Albret, who loved women more than wine; and Gironne,
who loved wine more than women; and Choisy,
who never knew which to love the best, but with
whom both disagreed.
</p>
<p>
At the present moment the party was extremely
hilarious. Its members had ransacked the toy-shops
of the fair, and every man was carrying some plaything
and making the most of it, and extolling its
greater virtues than the playthings of his fellows.
Taranne carried a pea-shooter, and peppered his
companion&#8217;s legs persistently, grinning with delight
if any of his victims showed irritation. Oriol had got
a large trumpet, and was blowing it lustily. Nocé
had bought a cup-and-ball, and was trying, not very
successfully, to induce the sphere to abide in the hollow
prepared for it. Navailles had got a large Pulcinello
doll that squeaked, and was pretending to treat
it as an oracle, and to interpret its mechanical utterances
as profound comments on his companions
and prophecies as to their fortunes. Albret was tripping
over a skipping-rope; Gironne puffed at a spinning
windmill; Choisy played on a bagpipes, and
Montaubert on a flute. In the background Monsieur
Peyrolles watched all this mirthfulness with indifference
and his master&#8217;s face with attention.
</p>
<p>
Gonzague looked round upon his friends with the
indulgent smile of a still youthful school-master surrounded
by his promising pupils. "Well, gentlemen,
does the fair amuse you?" he asked, urbanely.
</p>
<p>
Navailles turned to his doll for inspiration, made it
give its metallic squeak, and then, as if repeating
what Pulcinello had whispered to him, replied: "Enormously."
</p>
<p>
Oriol trumpeted his approval loudly, and the expressions
of the others bore ample testimony to their
enjoyment.
</p>
<p>
"Well, gentlemen," said Gonzague, "I hope and
think that I reserved the best for the end." He made
a sign to Peyrolles, who approached him. "Where is
the girl?" he questioned, in a low voice.
</p>
<p>
Peyrolles pointed to the caravan. "Shall I bring
her?" he asked.
</p>
<p>
Gonzague nodded. Peyrolles crossed the grass, his
course followed curiously by the eyes of Gonzague&#8217;s
friends, till he halted at the caravan and knocked at
the door. Flora put out her head, and, recognizing
Peyrolles, greeted him with an eager smile.
</p>
<p>
"The time has come," said Peyrolles, in a low voice,
"for you to dance to this gentleman."
</p>
<p>
Flora touched him eagerly on the arm. "Which is
my prince?" she asked.
</p>
<p>
Peyrolles gave a jerk of his head in the direction of
Gonzague, and answered: "He in black with the star."
</p>
<p>
In a moment Flora had retired within the caravan,
and emerged again with a pair of castanets in her
hands. She advanced to Gonzague and made him a
reverence. "Shall I dance for you, pretty gentleman?"
she asked.
</p>
<p>
Gonzague watched her curiously, seeing in one
swift, incisive glance that she might very well serve
for his purpose. "With all my heart," he answered,
courteously.
</p>
<p>
He seated himself at a table under the trees, with
his little court grouped about him, and Flora began
to dance. It was such a dance as only a Spaniard
trained in the gypsy school could dance&mdash;a dance whose
traditions go back to days when the Roman Empire
was old, to days when the Roman Empire was young.
Now active, now languid, by turns passionate, daring,
defiant, alluring, a wonderful medley of exquisite contradictions,
the girl leaped hither and thither, clicking
her castanets and sending her bright glances like
arrows towards the admiring spectators. She moved
like a flame fluttered by the wind, like a butterfly,
like a leaf, like any swift, volatile, shifting, shimmering
thing. She seemed as agile as a cat, as tireless as
a monkey, as free as a bird. Suddenly the dance that
was all contradiction ended in a final contradiction.
At the moment when her exuberance seemed keenest,
her vitality fiercest, her action most animated, when
her eyes were shining their brightest, her lips smiling
their sweetest, and her castanets clicking their
loudest, she suddenly became rigid, with arms extended,
like one struck motionless by a catalepsy, her face
robbed of all expression, her limbs stiff, her arms extended.
She stood so for a few seconds, then a smile
rippled over her face, her arms dropped to her sides,
and she seemed to swoon towards the ground in a
surrendering courtesy. The dance was at an end.
</p>
<p>
The delighted gentlemen applauded enthusiastically.
All would have been eager to seek closer acquaintance
with the gypsy, but all refrained because Gonzague
himself rose from his seat and advanced towards
the girl, who watched him, respectful and excited,
with lowered lids.
</p>
<p>
Gonzague laid his hand on her shoulder with a caress
that was almost paternal while he spoke: "I know
more about you than you know yourself, child. Go
back now. I have long been looking for you."
</p>
<p>
Flora could scarcely find breath to stammer: "For
me?" She ventured to look up into the face of this
grave and courtly gentleman, and she found something
very attractive in the dark eyes that were fixed upon
her with a look of so much benevolence. Gonzague
pointed to Peyrolles, who was standing a little apart
from the group of gentlemen.
</p>
<p>
"Peyrolles will come for you presently," he said.
"Peyrolles will tell you what to do. Obey him implicitly."
</p>
<p>
Flora made him another courtesy. "Yes, monseigneur,"
she faltered, and, turning, ran swiftly to the
caravan and disappeared within its depths. Each of
the young gentlemen gladly would have followed her,
but, as before, they were restrained by the action of
Gonzague, who seemed to have taken the girl under
his protection, and no one of them was foolhardy
enough to dream of crossing Gonzague in a pleasure
or a caprice.
</p>
<p>
But during the progress of the dance there had been
an addition to the little group of gentlemen. Chavernay
had come over the bridge, with, curiously enough,
Cocardasse and Passepoil at his heels. When he saw
that a dance was toward, he made a sign to his followers
to remain upon the bridge, while he himself
mingled with his habitual companions. When the
dance was over and Flora had disappeared, Chavernay
advanced to Gonzague. He, at least, was foolhardy
enough for anything. "I give you my word,
cousin," he said, "that I have already lost the half of
my heart to your dancer. Are we rivals with the
gypsy lass, cousin?"
</p>
<p>
Gonzague looked urbanely and yet gravely at his
impudent kinsman. "You must look for love elsewhere,"
he said, decisively. "I have reasons, though
not such reasons as yours; but you will oblige me."
</p>
<p>
Chavernay laughed contentedly. "My faith! there
are plenty of pretty women in the world, and plenty
of ugly men, as it would seem. I have brought you
some friends of yours."
</p>
<p>
He made a signal as he spoke, and Cocardasse
and Passepoil, descending from their post upon the
bridge, advanced towards the brilliant group, bowing
grotesquely as they did so, with their big hats in their
hands and their long rapiers tilting up their ragged
cloaks. All the party gazed in amazement at the
whimsical apparitions, to the great indignation of
Cocardasse, who whispered angrily to his companion:
"Why the devil do they stare at us so?" While
to him his companion replied, soothingly: "Gently,
gently."
</p>
<p>
The gentlemen were screaming with laughter. Taranne
fired a volley of peas, which rattled harmlessly
against the long boots of Passepoil. Navailles consulted
his oracle, and declared that he liked the big
one best. Oriol, with a flourish of his trumpet, announced
that he preferred the smug fellow. Peyrolles,
with a look of horror on his face, rushed forward
and attempted to intercept the new-comers,
but he was too late. Cocardasse was already in front
of Gonzague, and had made him a tremendous obeisance.
"We have the honor to salute your highness,"
he said, sonorously.
</p>
<p>
Gonzague observed him with well-restrained astonishment,
and questioned Chavernay: "Who are
these&mdash;gentlemen?"
</p>
<p>
Chavernay was eager to explain that he had come
across them in the fair, and had taken a great fancy
to them. After some conversation he found that they
were seeking the Prince de Gonzague, and thereupon
he had consented to be their guide and to present
them. At this point Peyrolles interposed. Coming
close to Gonzague, he whispered something to him
which caused for a moment a slight expression of dislike,
almost of dread, to disturb the familiar imperturbability
of his countenance. Then he looked at
the bravos. "Gentlemen," he said, "I believe it is
your wish to serve me. A man can never have too
many friends. Gentlemen, I accept your services."
He turned to his familiar, and ordered: "Peyrolles,
get them some new clothes."
</p>
<p>
Peyrolles hurriedly beckoned Cocardasse and Passepoil
apart, and could be seen at a little distance transferring
money from his pocket to their palms, giving
them instructions, and finally dismissing them.
</p>
<p>
Chavernay looked at Gonzague. "I congratulate
you on your new friends."
</p>
<p>
Gonzague shook his head. "Judge no man by his
habit. Hearts of gold may beat beneath those tatters."
</p>
<p>
Chavernay smiled. "I dare say they are no worse
than most of your friends."
</p>
<p>
Taranne, Nocé, Navailles, Oriol, Albret, Choisy,
Gironne, and Montaubert caught him up angrily.
They seemed offended at the suggestion. Gonzague
placated them with a phrase: "Our dear Chavernay
includes himself, no doubt."
</p>
<p>
Chavernay accepted the suggestion. "Oh yes;
there is devilishly little to choose between any of us."
</p>
<p>
The impertinence of the answer and the impertinence
of the speaker&#8217;s carriage were not calculated to
smooth the ruffled feelings of the gentlemen, but
Chavernay was never one to bridle his speech in deference
to the susceptibility of his cousin&#8217;s satellites.
He now eyed them mockingly, even provokingly, full
of amusement, while they fumed and fretted, and
hands crept to hilts. Cheerfully courageous, Chavernay
was prepared at any moment to back his words
with his sword. Gonzague, studying the lowering
faces of his adherents, and smiling compassionately
at the boyish insolence of Chavernay, interposed and
stifled the threatened brawl. "Come, gentlemen," he
said, graciously, "let there be no bickering. Chavernay
has a sharp tongue, and spares no one, not even
me, yet I am always ready to forgive him his impudence."
</p>
<p>
A word of Gonzague was a command&mdash;a wish, a
law&mdash;to his faithful followers, and their countenances
cleared as he spoke. Gonzague went on: "His Gracious
Majesty the King will be leaving the fair soon,
though I am glad to think that it seems to have diverted
his majesty greatly. Let us attend upon him,
gentlemen." Gonzague emphasized his words by
leading the way across the bridge, and Chavernay
and the others followed at his heels, a laughing, chattering,
many-colored company of pleasure-seekers.
Only Peyrolles remained behind.
</p>
<p>
When the last of them had crossed the bridge and
was far away upon the road to Neuilly, a man came
to the door of the Inn and looked thoughtfully after
them.
</p>
<p>
The man was clad in black from head to foot, and
his body was heavily bowed. As he moved slowly
across the grass, Peyrolles hastened towards him,
seeming to recognize him. "I was looking for you,
Master Æsop," he cried; "I have good news for you."
</p>
<p>
The hunchback answered, quietly: "Good news is
always welcome." And to the ears of Peyrolles the
voice was the voice of Æsop, and to the eyes of Peyrolles
the form and the face of the speaker were the
form and the face of Æsop.
</p>
<p>
Peyrolles went on: "His highness the Prince de
Gonzague is delighted with the girl you have found;
she will pass admirably for the girl of Nevers."
</p>
<p>
The seeming Æsop nodded his head and said, quietly:
"I am glad to hear it."
</p>
<p>
"The Prince wishes to see you," Peyrolles continued.
"The Prince wishes you to enter his service.
Master Æsop, Master Æsop, your fortune is
made, thanks to me."
</p>
<p>
"Thanks to me, I think," the hunchback commented,
dryly.
</p>
<p>
Peyrolles shrugged his shoulders. "As you please,"
he said. "Come to the Hôtel de Gonzague to-morrow,
and ask for me."
</p>
<p>
"I will come," the hunchback promised. Then
Peyrolles hastened over the bridge, and made all speed
to rejoin his master.
</p>
<p>
When he was well on his way the hunchback drew
himself into a chair, laughing heartily. "Oh, Æsop,
Æsop," Lagardere murmured to himself, "how vexed
you would be if you knew how useful you prove to
me!"

<a name='XIX_THE_HALL_OF_THE_THREE_LOUIS' id='XIX_THE_HALL_OF_THE_THREE_LOUIS'></a>
<h2>XIX</h2>
<h3>THE HALL OF THE THREE LOUIS</h3>
</div>

<p>
One of the handsomest rooms in the Palace of
Gonzague, as the Palace of Nevers was now called,
was known as the Hall of the Three Louis. It was
so called on account of the three life-sized portraits
which it contained. The first was the portrait of the
late duke, Louis de Nevers, in all the pride of that
youth and joyousness which was so tragically extinguished
in the moat of Caylus. His fair hair fell
about his delicate, eager face; his left hand rested
upon the hilt of the sword he knew how to use so
well; his right hand, perhaps in the pathos, perhaps
in the irony of the painter&#8217;s intention, was pressed
against his heart, for Louis de Nevers had been a
famous lover in his little day, but never so true a
lover as when he wooed and won the daughter of the
hostile house of Caylus. A heavy curtain by the
side of the picture masked an alcove sacred to the
memory of Nevers.
</p>
<p>
Facing the portrait of the dead duke was the portrait
of his successor, of the present master of the
house. Louis de Gonzague, in all other things a
contrast to Louis de Nevers, contrasted with him most
flagrantly in appearance. Against the fair, boyish
face of Nevers you had to set the saturnine Italianate
countenance of Gonzague. The brilliancy of Louis
de Nevers was all external, bright as summer is bright,
gay as summer is gay, cheerful as summer is cheerful.
The brilliancy of Louis de Gonzague showed more
sombrely, as melting gold flows in a crucible. No one
who saw the picture could fail to deny its physical
beauty, but many would deny it the instant, the
appealing charm which caught at the heart of the
spectator with the first glance he gave to the canvas
that portrayed Louis de Nevers. In contrast, too,
were the very garments of the two men, for the dead
duke affected light, airy, radiant colors&mdash;clear blues,
and clear pale-yellows, and delicate reds with subtle
emphasis of gold and silver; but the splendor of Gonzague&#8217;s
apparel was sombre, like his beauty, with
black for its dominant note, and only deep wine-colored
crimsons or fierce ambers to lighten its
solemnity.
</p>
<p>
The third picture, which was placed between Louis
de Nevers and Louis de Gonzague, was the portrait of
Louis, not as he now looked, being King of France in
reality, but as he looked some seventeen years earlier,
when the cardinal was beginning his career, and when
the peevishness of youth had not soured into the yellow
melancholy of the monarch of middle age.
</p>
<p>
It was in this room, consecrated to the memory of
his dead friend, to the honor of his living friend, and
to the glory of his own existence, that Louis de Gonzague
loved to work. It was a proof of his well-balanced
philosophy that he found nothing to trouble
him in the juxtaposition of the three pictures. The
great double doors at one end of the room served to
shut off a hall devoted for the most part to the private
suppers which it was Louis de Gonzague&#8217;s delight to
give to chosen friends of both sexes, and when, as
often happened, supper ended, and a choice company
of half-drunken women and wholly drunken men
reeled through the open doors into the room where
the three Louis reigned, Gonzague, who himself kept
always sober, was no more than cynically amused by
the contrast between the noisy and careless crew
who had invaded the chamber and the sinister gravity
with which the portraits of the three Louis regarded
one another.
</p>
<p>
The king himself, who sometimes since his freedom
surreptitiously made one at these merry gatherings,
where a princely fortune and a more than princely
taste directed all that appealed to all appetites&mdash;the
king himself, coming flushed from one of these
famous suppers into the sudden coolness and quiet
of the great room, would appear to be more impressed
than his host at the sudden sight of the three canvases.
Then, in a voice perhaps slightly unsteady,
but still carrying in its flood the utterance of a steady
purpose, Louis of France would catch Louis de Gonzague
by the wrist, and, pointing to the bright, smiling
image of Louis de Nevers, would repeat for the twentieth,
the fiftieth, the hundredth time his oath of
vengeance against the assassin of his friend if ever
that assassin should come into his power. And hearing
this oath for the twentieth, the fiftieth, the hundredth
time, Louis de Gonzague would always smile
his astute smile and incline his head gravely in sign
of sympathy with the king&#8217;s feelings, and allow his
fine eyes to be dimmed for an instant with a suggestion
of tears.
</p>
<p>
The room was an interesting room to any one curious
as to the concerns of the Prince de Gonzague for other
reasons than the presence of the three pictures, for
to any one who knew anything about the arrangements of
the palace this room represented, as it were,
a kind of debatable land between the kingdom of
Gonzague on the one side and the kingdom of Nevers
on the other. A door on the left communicated with
the private apartments of Louis de Gonzague. Cross
the great room to the right, and you came to a
door communicating with the private apartments of
Madame the Princess de Gonzague. The Prince de
Gonzague never passed the threshold of the door that
led to the princess&#8217;s apartments. The Princess de
Gonzague never passed the threshold of the door that
led to the prince&#8217;s apartments. Ever since their
strange marriage the man and the woman had lived
thus apart; the man, on his part, always courteous,
always deferential, always tender, always ready to
be respectfully affectionate, and the woman, on her
part, icily reserved, wrapped around in the blackness
of her widowhood, inexorably deaf to all wooing, immovably
resolute to be alone.
</p>
<p>
What rumor said was, for once, quite true. The
young Duchess de Nevers, on the night of her marriage
to Prince Louis de Gonzague, had warned him
that if he attempted to approach her with the solicitations
of a husband she would take her life, and Louis
de Gonzague, who, being an Italian, was ardent, but
who, being an Italian, was also very intelligent, saw
that the young wife-widow meant what she said and
would keep her word, and desisted discreetly from
any attempt to play the husband. After all, he had
his consolations: he controlled the vast estates of
his dead friend and kinsman, and though he felt for
the lady he had married a certain animal attraction,
which easily cooled as the years went on, his passion
for the wealth of Nevers was more pronounced than
his passion for the wife of Nevers, and he contented
himself easily enough with the part assigned to him
by his wife in the tragi-comedy. Every day he
requested, very courteously, through Monsieur Peyrolles,
permission to wait upon the princess, and every
day the princess, also through a servant, expressed
her regret that the state of her health would not allow
her the pleasure of receiving his highness. So it
had been through the years since Louis de Nevers
was done to death in the moat of Caylus.
</p>
<p>
On the day after the fair at Neuilly, Louis de Gonzague
was seated in the room of the Three Louis
busily writing at a table. By his side stood Peyrolles,
his gorgeous attire somewhat unpleasantly
accentuating the patent obsequiousness with which
he waited upon his master&#8217;s will. For a while Gonzague&#8217;s
busy pen formed flowing Italian characters
upon the page before him. Presently he came to an
end, reread his letter, shook over the final writings
some silver sand, then folded it and sealed it leisurely.
When he had done he spoke to Peyrolles:
</p>
<p>
"This letter is to go to his majesty. Send Doña
Flora here. Stay! Who is in the antechamber?"
</p>
<p>
Peyrolles answered with a bow: "The Chevalier
Cocardasse and the Chevalier Passepoil, monseigneur."
</p>
<p>
Gonzague made a faint grimace. "Let them wait
there."
</p>
<p>
Peyrolles inclined profoundly. "Yes, monseigneur,"
he said, and waited. The long knowledge of
his master&#8217;s manner, the long study of the expression
on his master&#8217;s face, told him he had not done with
him, and he was right, for in a moment Gonzague
spoke to him again:
</p>
<p>
"This gypsy girl will serve the turn to perfection.
She is dark, as Gabrielle de Caylus was dark. She is
beautiful, not so beautiful as Gabrielle de Caylus indeed,
but, bah! filia pulchra, matre pulchrior. Before
the king to-day I will produce her. The princess cannot
but accept her. If afterwards a charming young
girl should die of a decline&mdash;many die so&mdash;the fortune
of Louis de Nevers becomes the fortune of Louis de
Gonzague, who will know very well what to do with
it, having the inestimable advantage of being alive."
</p>
<p>
Peyrolles indulged in the privilege of a faint little
laugh at this witticism of his master, but apparently
the applause did not please Gonzague, who gave him
a gesture of dismissal. "Send the girl to me at once,"
he said; and with a still more humble salute Peyrolles
quitted the apartment. When Gonzague was
alone he sat for a few minutes staring before him like
one who dreams waking. Then he turned and glanced
at the picture of Louis de Nevers, and an ironical smile
wrinkled, more than time had ever done, his handsome
face. Evidently the contemplation of the picture
seemed to afford him a great deal of satisfaction,
for he was still looking at it, and still wearing the same
amused smile, when the door behind him opened and
Flora came timidly into the room. She was not in
appearance the same Flora who had dwelt in the
caravan and danced for strangers on the previous day.
She was now richly and beautifully dressed as a great
lady should be, but she seemed more awkward in her
splendid garments than she had ever seemed in the
short skirts of the gypsy. Gonzague, whose every
sense was acute, heard her come in, though she stepped
very softly, and abandoned his contemplation of
the picture of Louis de Nevers. He turned round and
rose to his feet, and made her one of his exquisite
salutations. The girl drew back with a little gasp
and pressed her hands to her bosom.
</p>
<p>
Gonzague smiled paternally. "Are you afraid of
me?"
</p>
<p>
The girl shook her head dubiously, and there was
suspicion in her dark eyes as she asked: "What do
you want of me?"
</p>
<p>
Gonzague smiled more paternally than before. "I
want you to love me," he said; and then, seeing that
the gypsy lifted her brows, he continued, leisurely:
"Do not misunderstand me. Women still are sometimes
pleased to smile on me. I do not want such
smiles from you, child. There is another fate for
you. Are you content with your new life?"
</p>
<p>
Flora answered him with a weary tone in her voice
and a weary look on her pretty face. "You have
given me fine clothes and fine jewels. I ought to be
content. But I miss my comrades and my wandering
life."
</p>
<p>
Gonzague was still paternal as he explained: "You
must forget your wandering life. Henceforward you
are a great lady. Your father was a duke."
</p>
<p>
Flora gave a little gasp, and questioned: "Is my
father dead?"
</p>
<p>
Gonzague allowed his chin to fall upon his breast
and an expression of deep gloom to overshadow his
face. "Yes," he said, and his voice was as a requiem
to buried friendship.
</p>
<p>
Flora&#8217;s heart was touched by this display of friendship.
"And my mother?" she asked.
</p>
<p>
Gonzague&#8217;s face lightened. "Your mother lives."
</p>
<p>
Flora questioned again, this time very timorously:
"Will she love me?"
</p>
<p>
Gonzague seemed to look at the girl sympathetically,
but really looked at her critically. He found her
so pleasing to his eye that he almost regretted that
she had been chosen for the part she had to play,
but also he found her on the whole so suited to that
part that he felt bound to stifle his regret. "Surely,"
he said, and smiled kindly upon her.
</p>
<p>
Flora gave a little sigh of satisfaction. "I have
always dreamed that I should be a great lady. And
dreams come true, you know&mdash;the dreams that gypsies
dream."
</p>
<p>
Gonzague raised his hand to check her speech.
"Forget the gypsies. Forget that the gypsies called
you Flora. Your name is Gabrielle."
</p>
<p>
Flora gave a start of surprise. "Gabrielle!" she
said. "How strange! That is the name of my dearest
friend."
</p>
<p>
It was Gonzague&#8217;s turn to be surprised, but he never
was known to betray an emotion. It was with an air
of complete indifference that he asked: "Who is she?"
</p>
<p>
And Flora answered, simply: "A girl I knew and
loved when we were living in Spain."
</p>
<p>
Gonzague knew that he was agitated; and that he
had every reason to be agitated, but he knew also
that no one beholding him would know of his agitation.
"What became of her?" he asked, still with
the same apparent indifference.
</p>
<p>
And Flora answered as readily as before: "We
travelled to France together."
</p>
<p>
"Travelled to France together!" echoed Gonzague.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps, in spite of himself, some hint of keenness
was betrayed in the voice he was so studious to keep
indifferent, for this time Flora gave question for
question, suspiciously: "Why does all this interest
you?"
</p>
<p>
Gonzague&#8217;s voice was perfectly indifferent when he
replied: "Everything that concerns you interests me.
Tell me; was this other Gabrielle a Spaniard like you?"
</p>
<p>
Flora shook her head. "Oh no. She was French."
</p>
<p>
"Was she, too, an orphan?" Gonzague asked.
</p>
<p>
"Yes," said Flora; "but she had a guardian who
loved her like a father."
</p>
<p>
The gypsy girl could not guess what raging passions
were masked by the changeless serenity of Gonzague&#8217;s
face. "Who was that?" he asked, as he might have
asked the name of some dog or some cat.
</p>
<p>
And he got the answer he expected from the girl:
"A young French soldier."
</p>
<p>
Perhaps, again, Gonzague&#8217;s voice was keener with
his next question: "Whose name was&mdash;"
</p>
<p>
In this case Flora, suddenly recalling her conversation
with Gabrielle on the previous day, became as
suddenly cautious. "I have forgotten his name,"
she said, and looked as if nothing could rekindle her
memory.
</p>
<p>
Gonzague affected to be busy with some of the
papers that lay before him, and then, at a venture,
and as if with no particular purpose in his thoughts,
he said: "I wish I could get this Gabrielle to be your
companion, child."
</p>
<p>
Flora clapped her hands, and forgot her caution in
her joy at the prospect. "Well, that might be done.
I will tell you a secret. Gabrielle and her guardian
are in Paris."
</p>
<p>
Underneath the table, and hidden from the girl&#8217;s
sight, Gonzague&#8217;s hands clinched tightly, as if they
were clinching upon the throat of an enemy; but his
face was still quite tranquil as he said, carelessly:
"Where are they?"
</p>
<p>
Flora&#8217;s voice was full of regret. "Ah! I do not
know; but they were at the fair where we were playing,
and I know that they are coming to Paris."
</p>
<p>
Gonzague rose to his feet and took both the girl&#8217;s
hands affectionately in his. His eyes looked affectionately
into hers, and his voice was full of kindness.
"If your friend can be found, be sure that I will find
her for you. And now go. I will send for you when
the time comes for the meeting with your mother."
</p>
<p>
Flora clasped her hands nervously. "My mother!
Oh, what shall I say to her?" she cried.
</p>
<p>
Gonzague&#8217;s smile soothed her fears. "Hide nothing
from her, for I am sure you have nothing to hide.
Speak the loving words that a mother would like to
hear."
</p>
<p>
With a grateful look at her newly found protector,
Flora darted from the room, and Gonzague was left
alone.

<h3>A CONFIDENTIAL AGENT</h3>
</div>

<p>
Gonzague was left alone, indeed, only in a
sense, for on a sudden the great hall with its
famous pictures had become the theatre of fierce
emotions and menacing presences. Just at the moment
when Gonzague believed his schemes to be at
their best and his fortunes to be nearing their top,
he was suddenly threatened with the renewal of the
old terror that had been kept at bay through all the
years that had passed since the night of Caylus.
Through all these years Lagardere had been kept from
Paris, at the cost, indeed, as he believed, of many
lives, but that was a price Louis de Gonzague was
always prepared to pay when the protection of his
own life was in question. Now it would seem as if
Lagardere had broken his exile, had forced his way
through the thicket of swords, and was again in Paris.
Nor was this the worst. Just when Gonzague, after
all his failures to trace the missing child of his victim,
just when he had so ingeniously found a substitute
for that missing child, it would really seem as if the
child herself, now a woman, had come to Paris to
defy him and to destroy his plans. He sat huddled
with black thoughts for a time which seemed to him
an age, but was in reality not more than a few moments;
then, extending his hand, he struck a bell and
a servant entered.
</p>
<p>
"Tell Peyrolles I want him," the prince commanded,
and was again alone with his dreads and his dangers
until Peyrolles appeared. Gonzague turned to his
factotum. "I have reason to suspect that Lagardere
is in Paris. If it be true, he will come too late. The
princess will have accepted the gypsy as her child,
the mother&#8217;s voice will have spoken. If Lagardere
is in Paris, he and the girl must be found, and once
found&mdash;"
</p>
<p>
The ivory-like face of Peyrolles was quickened with
a cunning look. "I have a man who will find him if
any one can."
</p>
<p>
Gonzague turned upon him sharply. "Who is it?"
</p>
<p>
"Monseigneur," said Peyrolles, "I have at my disposal,
and at the disposal of your highness, a very
remarkable man, the hunchback Æsop. He was in
the moat of Caylus that night. He, with those two
you saw yesterday, are the only ones left, except&mdash;"
</p>
<p>
Peyrolles paused for a moment, and his pale face
worked uncomfortably. Gonzague interpreted his
thought. "Except you and me, you were going to
say."
</p>
<p>
Peyrolles nodded gloomily. "As Æsop," he said,
"has been in Spain all these years hunting Lagardere&mdash;"
</p>
<p>
"Yes," Gonzague interrupted, "and never finding
him."
</p>
<p>
Peyrolles bowed. "True, your highness, but at
least up to now he has kept Lagardere on the Spanish
side of the frontier, kept Lagardere in peril of his life.
Æsop hates Lagardere, always has hated him. When
the last of our men met with"&mdash;he paused for a moment
as if to find a fitting phrase, and then continued&mdash;"the
usual misfortune, I thought it useless to leave
Æsop in Spain, and sent for him. He came to me
to-day. May I present him to your highness?"
</p>
<p>
Gonzague nodded thoughtfully. Any ally was welcome
in such a crisis. "Yes," he said.
</p>
<p>
Peyrolles went to the door that communicated
with the prince&#8217;s private apartments, and, opening it,
beckoned into the corridor. Then he drew back into
the room, and a moment later was followed by a
hunchbacked man in black, who wore a large sword.
The man bowed profoundly to the Prince de Gonzague.
</p>
<p>
Peyrolles introduced him. "This is the man, monseigneur."
</p>
<p>
Gonzague looked fixedly at the man. He could see
little of his face, for the head was thrust forward from
the stooping, misshapen shoulders, and his long, dark
hair hung about his cheeks and shaded his countenance.
The face seemed pale and intelligent. It was
naturally quite unfamiliar to Gonzague, who knew
nothing of Æsop except as one of the men who had
played a sinister part in the murder at Caylus.
</p>
<p>
Gonzague addressed him. "You know much, they
tell me?"
</p>
<p>
The man bowed again, and spoke, slowly: "I know
that Lagardere is in Paris, and with the child of
Nevers."
</p>
<p>
"Do you know where he is?" Gonzague questioned.
</p>
<p>
The man answered, with laconic confidence: "I will
find out."
</p>
<p>
"How?" asked Gonzague.
</p>
<p>
The hunchback laughed dryly. "That is my secret.
Paris cannot hold any mystery from me."
</p>
<p>
Gonzague questioned again: "Is it to your interest
that Lagardere should die?"
</p>
<p>
"Indeed, yes," the hunchback answered. "Has he
not sworn to kill every man who attacked Nevers that
night? Has he not kept his word well? I am the
last that is left&mdash;I and Monsieur Peyrolles, for, of
course, I except your Excellence. I promise you I
will find him, but I shall need help."
</p>
<p>
"Help?" Gonzague echoed.
</p>
<p>
The hunchback nodded. "He is a dangerous fellow,
this Lagardere, as six of us have found to our
cost. Are there not two of our number newly in
your highness&#8217;s service?"
</p>
<p>
"Cocardasse and Passepoil," Peyrolles explained.
</p>
<p>
The hunchback rubbed his hands. "The very men.
Will your highness place them under my orders?"
</p>
<p>
"By all means," Gonzague answered, and, turning
to Peyrolles, he said: "They are in the antechamber;
bring them in."
</p>
<p>
Peyrolles turned to obey, when the hunchback delayed
him with a gesture. "Your pardon, highness,"
he said; "but I think there is another service I can
render you to-day."
</p>
<p>
"Another service?" Gonzague repeated, looking at
the hunchback with some surprise.
</p>
<p>
The hunchback explained: "Your highness, as I
understand, has summoned for this afternoon a small
family council, ostensibly for the purpose of considering
the position of affairs between madame the princess
and yourself."
</p>
<p>
The hunchback paused. Gonzague nodded, but
said nothing, and the hunchback resumed: "Your
real purpose, however, as I understand, is to present
to that council the young lady, the daughter of Nevers,
whom I have been fortunate enough to discover in
Spain. You wish this discovery to come as a surprise
to madame the princess."
</p>
<p>
Still Gonzague nodded, still Gonzague kept silence.
</p>
<p>
"I believe that you have requested madame the
princess to attend this family council, and that up
to the present you have not succeeded in obtaining
her assent."
</p>
<p>
"That is so," said Gonzague.
</p>
<p>
"I was about to suggest," the hunchback went on,
"if your highness will permit me, that you should
employ me as your ambassador to madame the princess.
I believe I could persuade her to be present
at the family gathering."
</p>
<p>
Gonzague looked at the man in astonishment.
"What persuasions could you employ," he asked,
"which would be likely to succeed where mine have
failed?"
</p>
<p>
Again Æsop made an apologetic gesture as he
pleaded his former excuse. "That is my secret," he
repeated; "but, prince, if you employ me you must
let me attain my ends by my own means, so long as
you find that those ends give you satisfaction and
are of service to your purposes. Though I am by no
means"&mdash;here he laughed a little, bitter laugh&mdash;"an
attractive person, I believe I have a keen wit, and I
think I have a clever tongue, thanks to which I have
often succeeded in difficult enterprises where others
have failed ignominiously&mdash;at least, it will be no
harm to try."
</p>
<p>
"Certainly," Gonzague agreed, "it will be no harm
to try. If the princess persists, I could, of course,
in the end compel her by a direct order from the king
himself, who is good enough to honor us with his
presence to-day."
</p>
<p>
"But," the hunchback interrupted, "it would be
far more agreeable to you if the princess could be
induced to come of her own accord?"
</p>
<p>
"Certainly," Gonzague agreed.
</p>
<p>
"Then," said the hunchback, "have I permission
to approach madame the princess and endeavor to
persuade her to act in conformity to your wishes?"
</p>
<p>
"You have," said Gonzague, decisively. Something
in the hunchback&#8217;s manner attracted him. The
suggestion of mysterious influences appealed to his
Italian spirit, and the confidence of the hunchback
inspired him with confidence. He pointed to the
curtained alcove.
</p>
<p>
"Madame the princess," he said, gravely, "comes
every day at this hour to spend some moments in
contemplation and in prayer beside the picture of her
former husband. That alcove shrines his sword. By
virtue of a mutual understanding, this room is always
left empty daily at this same time, that madame the
princess may fulfil her pious duty untroubled by the
sight of any who might be displeasing to her."
</p>
<p>
Here Gonzague sighed profoundly and summoned
to his face the expression of a much-wronged, grievously
misappreciated man. After an interval, which
the hunchback silently respected, Gonzague resumed:
</p>
<p>
"If she were to find you here the princess might
be, would be, pained; but if, indeed, you think you
have any arguments that would serve to influence
her mind, you could explain your presence as owing
to ignorance due to the newness of your service here."
</p>
<p>
Æsop nodded sagaciously. "I understand," he
said. "Leave it to me. And now if your highness
will place those two fellows at my disposal, I will
give them their instructions."
</p>
<p>
The prince rose and turned to Peyrolles. "Send
the men to Master Æsop," he commanded.
</p>
<p>
Peyrolles went to the door of the antechamber, and
returned in an instant with Cocardasse and Passepoil,
now both gorgeously dressed in an extravagantly
modish manner, which became them, if possible,
less than their previous rags and tatters. Both men
saluted Gonzague profoundly, and both started at
seeing the hunchback standing apart from them with
averted face.
</p>
<p>
Gonzague pointed to the hunchback. "Obey Master
Æsop, gentlemen, as you would obey me." The
two bravos bowed respectfully. Gonzague turned to
the hunchback and spoke in a lower tone: "Find
this Lagardere for me, and we will soon break his
invincible sword."
</p>
<p>
"How?" the hunchback questioned, with a faint
note of irony in his voice.
</p>
<p>
Gonzague continued: "By the hands of the hang-man,
Master Æsop. Do your best. Those who serve
me well serve themselves."
</p>
<p>
The hunchback answered, slowly: "Whenever you
want me, I am here."
</p>
<p>
Gonzague, in spite of himself, started at the hunchback&#8217;s
last words, but the demeanor of Æsop was so
simple and his bearing so respectful that Gonzague
was convinced that their use was purely accident.
He looked at his watch. "I must prepare for the
ceremony," he said. "Come with me, Peyrolles,"
and the prince and his henchman quitted the apartment.
</p>
<p>
The hunchback muttered to himself: "The sword
of Lagardere has yet a duty to perform before it be
broken." Then he turned to Cocardasse and Passepoil
where they stood apart: "Well, friends, do you
remember me?"
</p>
<p>
Cocardasse answered him, thoughtfully: "&#8217;Tis a
long time since we met, Æsop."
</p>
<p>
Passepoil, as usual, commented on his comrade&#8217;s
remark: "It might have been longer with advantage."
</p>
<p>
Indifferent to the bravos&#8217; obvious distaste for his
society, the hunchback continued: "I have news for
you. Lagardere and I met yesterday."
</p>
<p>
Cocardasse whistled. "The devil you did!"
</p>
<p>
The hunchback coolly continued: "We fought, and
I killed him."
</p>
<p>
Cocardasse&#8217;s air of distaste was suddenly transmuted
into a raging, blazing air of hatred. He swore
a great oath and sprang forward. "Then, by the
powers, I will kill you!"
</p>
<p>
"So will I!" cried Passepoil, no less furious than
his friend, and advanced with him. But when the
pair were close upon the hunchback he suddenly
drew himself up, flung back the hair from his face,
and faced them, crying, "I am here!"
</p>
<p>
Cocardasse and Passepoil paused, gasping. Both
had one name on their lips, and the name was the
name of Lagardere. In another moment Lagardere
was stooping again, the long hair was falling about
his face, and the two men could scarcely believe that
Æsop was not standing before them. "Hush! To
you both, as to all the world, I am Æsop, Gonzague&#8217;s
attendant devil. Now I have work for you. Go
to-night at eleven to No. 7, Rue de Chantre." As he
spoke he drew a letter from his coat and gave it to
Cocardasse. "Give this letter to the young lady
who lives there. I have warned her of your coming.
I have told her what she is to do. She will accompany
you unquestioningly. I have to trust to you
in this, friends, for I have my own part to play, and,
by my faith, it is the hardest part I have ever played
in my life." He laughed as he spoke; then he drew
from his breast another packet and handed it to
Passepoil. "Here," he said, "are three invitations
for the king&#8217;s ball to-night&mdash;one for the girl you will
escort, one for each of you. When you go to the
house you will wait till the girl is ready, and then you
will escort her to the king&#8217;s ball in the Palais Royal
at midnight, and bring her into the presence of the king
by the royal tent near the round pond of Diana."
</p>
<p>
"I will do that same," said Cocardasse, cheerfully.
</p>
<p>
"Never let her out of your sight at the ball," Lagardere
insisted.
</p>
<p>
"Devil a minute," Passepoil affirmed.
</p>
<p>
"Let no one speak to her," Lagardere continued.
</p>
<p>
"Devil a word," said Cocardasse.
</p>
<p>
As the hunchback seemed to have no further instructions
for them, the pair made to depart, but
Lagardere restrained them, saying: "Ah, wait a moment.
We are all the toys of fate. If any unlucky
chance should arise, come to me in the presence of
the king and fling down your glove."
</p>
<p>
"I understand," said Cocardasse.
</p>
<p>
Lagardere dismissed them. "Then, farewell, old
friends, till to-night."

<h2>XXI</h2>
<h3>THE PRINCESS DE GONZAGUE</h3>
</div>

<p>
When Lagardere was left alone he placed himself
at the table where Gonzague had been sitting
so short a time before, and, taking pen and paper,
wrote rapidly a short letter. When he had folded
and sealed this, he rose, and, crossing the room, went
to the door which opened on the antechamber to
the princess&#8217;s apartments. Here he found a servant
waiting, wearing the mourning livery of Nevers,
to whom he gave the letter, telling him that it was
urgent, and that it should be delivered to the princess
at once. When he had done this he returned to
the great room and walked slowly up and down it,
surveying in turn each of the three pictures of the
three friends who had been called the Three Louis.
He paused for a moment before the picture of Louis
de Nevers. "Louis de Nevers," he said, softly, "you
shall be avenged to-night."
</p>
<p>
He moved a little away, and paused again before
the portrait of the king. "Louis of France," he
said, "you shall be convinced to-night."
</p>
<p>
A third time he resumed his walk, and a third time
he paused, this time before the portrait of the Prince
de Gonzague. Here he stood a little while longer in
silence, studying curiously the striking lineaments of
his enemy, that enemy who, through all the change
of years, had retained the grace and beauty represented
on the canvas. "Louis de Gonzague," he
murmured, "you shall be judged to-night."
</p>
<p>
Then he resumed his steady pacing up and down
the room, with his hands clasped lightly behind his
humped shoulders, busy in thought. For, indeed, he
had much to think of, much to plan, much to execute,
and but little time in which to do what he had to do.
Fortune had greatly favored him so far. The friends
he had summoned had come at his call. One more of
his enemies had been swept from his path, and by the
destruction of that enemy he had been able, thanks
to his old training as a play-actor, to enter unsuspected
into the household and the councils of the man
who most hated him, of the man whom he most hated.
But, though much was done, there was yet much to
do, and it needed all his fortitude, all his courage, and
all his humor to face without hesitation or alarm the
problems that faced him.
</p>
<p>
His reflections were interrupted by the opening of
a door, and, turning rapidly, he found himself in the
presence of a woman clad entirely in black, whom he
knew at once, in spite of the ravages that time and an
unchanging grief had wrought upon her beauty, to
be the Princess de Gonzague, the widow of Nevers.
The princess was accompanied by a lady-in-waiting,
a woman older than herself, and, like herself, clad
wholly in black, on whose arm she leaned for support.
Lagardere bowed respectfully to the woman he had
last seen so many years before in the short and terrible
interview in the moat at Caylus.
</p>
<p>
"You requested to see me," the princess said,
gravely and sternly.
</p>
<p>
"I requested permission to wait upon you," Lagardere
answered, deferentially.
</p>
<p>
"You are," the princess continued, "I presume,
in the service of the Prince de Gonzague?"
</p>
<p>
Lagardere bowed in silence.
</p>
<p>
"It is not my custom," the princess said, "to receive
messengers from his highness, but it is my custom
daily to visit these rooms for a few moments at
this time to look at one of the pictures they contain,
and at this time his highness leaves the room at my
disposal. From the earnestness of your letter, I have,
therefore, consented to see you here in the course of
this, my daily pilgrimage. What have you got to say
to me?"
</p>
<p>
"Your highness," said Lagardere, "I am, as you
imagine, in the service of his highness the Prince de
Gonzague, but I have been out of France for many
years, and know little or nothing of the events which
have taken place in my absence. I understand, however,
that there is to be a family council held in the
palace to-day, and that it is my master&#8217;s earnest wish
that you should be present at that council."
</p>
<p>
The princess drew herself up and surveyed the
hunchback coldly. "There is no need," she said, "for
any such council nor any need for my presence. I
have told your master so already, and do not see why
I should be importuned to repeat my words."
</p>
<p>
Lagardere bowed again, and made as if to retire.
Then, as if suddenly recollecting something, he drew
from his breast a small, sealed package. "As I was
coming to the Hôtel de Gonzague this morning," he
said, "a man whom I do not know stopped me in the
street and gave me this package, with the request that
I should deliver it to your highness. I explained to
the man that I was in the service of his highness the
Prince de Gonzague, and had not the honor of being
included among your highness&#8217;s servants. But the
man still pressed me to take charge of this packet,
asking me to deliver it to the care of one of your highness&#8217;s
women, and I should have done so but that I
thought upon reflection it might be better, if possible,
to deliver it into your own hands."
</p>
<p>
As he spoke he extended the package, which the
princess received in silence and scrutinized carefully.
It was addressed to her in a handwriting that was
wholly unfamiliar, and carefully sealed with seals in
black wax, that bore the impression of the word
"Adsum." The princess looked keenly at the hunchback,
who stood quietly before her with bent head
in an attitude of respectful attention.
</p>
<p>
"Do you know anything further respecting this
package?" the princess asked.
</p>
<p>
Lagardere shook his head. "I have told your highness,"
he said, "all I know of the matter. I never
saw the man who gave it to me. I do not think I
should know him again."
</p>
<p>
The princess again examined the packet closely,
and then, advancing to the table, seated herself for
a moment and broke the seals. The contents of the
packet seemed to startle her, for she suddenly turned
to her waiting-woman and beckoned her to her side.
Then, with a gesture, she motioned to Lagardere to
stand farther apart. Lagardere withdrew to the remotest
corner of the apartment, and seemed lost in
contemplation of the portrait of Louis de Gonzague.
</p>
<p>
The princess spoke to her companion in low, hurried
tones. "Brigitte," she said, "here is something
strange." And she showed her a little book which
she had taken from the packet. "This is the prayer-book
which I gave to my husband at Caylus seventeen
years ago, and see what is written in it." And
she pointed to some words which were written on the
blank page inside the cover in the same handwriting
as that in which the packet was addressed. These
words the princess read over to her companion:
</p>
<p>
"&#8217;God will have pity if you have faith. Your child
lives and shall be restored to you to-day. Distrust
Gonzague more than ever. Remember the motto of
Louis de Nevers. During the council sit near his
picture, and at the right time, for you and for you
alone, the dead shall speak.&#8217;" These words were
signed, "Henri de Lagardere."
</p>
<p>
The princess turned and beckoned to the hunch-back,
who immediately approached her. "You are
my husband&#8217;s servant," she said. "Are you much in
his confidence?"
</p>
<p>
"Madame," Lagardere replied, "I am too new to
Paris to consider myself in any sense the confidential
servant of his highness, but I can assure you that I
hope to serve him as he deserves to be served."
</p>
<p>
The princess seemed thoughtful, then she asked
again: "Did you ever hear of a man named Henri de
Lagardere?"
</p>
<p>
The hunchback appeared agitated. "Madame," he
replied, "Henri de Lagardere is the enemy of my master,
and he is my enemy. I have been seeking him
unsuccessfully for many years, both in my master&#8217;s
interests and in my own."
</p>
<p>
The princess rose. "Enough, sir," she said. "I
will consider his highness&#8217;s wishes. Come, Brigitte."
</p>
<p>
Holding the packet in her hand and leaning on her
companion&#8217;s arm, she went towards the picture of
Louis de Nevers and knelt for a moment in prayer.
Then she rose and silently quitted the room, still
leaning on Brigitte&#8217;s arm.

<h2>XXII</h2>
<h3>THE FAMILY COUNCIL</h3>
</div>

<p>
Lagardere remained alone for a while in the
room, pensively contemplating the portraits of
the Three Louis. Then the sound of footsteps came
to his ears, footsteps advancing from many directions,
footsteps all making towards the great hall. He
smiled as a man smiles who is prepared to encounter
cheerfully great odds, and then, as if there were observing
eyes upon him, though indeed no eyes beheld
him save those that were painted in the canvases of
the three friends, he slouched across the room, more
markedly the hunchback than ever, till he came to
the curtained door by the side of the picture of Louis
de Nevers. He lifted the curtain, glanced round him
for a moment at the empty room, and then dipped
behind the curtain.
</p>
<p>
The curtain fell, the room was empty, save for the
painted presences of the Three Louis. But the room
was not empty long. A few moments later Gonzague
entered the room respectfully escorting his
illustrious master and friend, Louis of France. At
their heels followed a little crowd of notabilities,
eminent lawyers, eminent ecclesiastics, all of whom
had claim, by virtue of their kinship or by virtue of
their authority on delicate, contested family matters,
to a seat and a voice in the council that Louis
of Gonzague had been pleased to summon. After
these again came Gonzague&#8217;s own little tail of partisans,
Navailles and Nocé, Taranne and Oriol, Choisy
and Gironne, Albret and Montaubert, with Chavernay
fluttering about them like an impudent butterfly,
laughing at them, laughing at his august cousin,
laughing at the king, laughing at himself&mdash;laughing
at everything. To him such a family gathering as
this which he attended was almost the most ridiculous
thing imaginable on the face of the whole world, and
therefore deserving of consideration, if not of serious
consideration.
</p>
<p>
The king took his place upon the kind of little
throne which had been set apart for him. The rest
of the company arranged themselves with instinctive
sense of precedence upon the chairs that were ranged
behind it. To Chavernay the whole thing looked like
a pompous parody of a trial where there was nobody
to be tried, and he made unceasing jokes to his neighbors,
which compelled them to laugh. This earned
for him a disapproving glance from the dark eyes of
Gonzague, which had no effect whatever in depressing
his spirits.
</p>
<p>
When all the guests were duly seated, Gonzague
gravely rose, and, turning towards the king, saluted
him respectfully. "I thank your majesty," he said,
"for honoring us on this occasion, when matters of
great moment to me and to the lady whom I am proud
to call my wife, and to the great family with which
I am associated at once by ties of blood and alliance,
are in question. Your majesty will readily understand
that nothing but the gravest sense of duty
could have urged me to bring together so learned, so
just, so brilliant an assembly of men to deal with
delicate matters which have perhaps been too long left
undealt with. Such differences of opinion as may perhaps
be admitted to exist between madame the Princess
de Gonzague and myself, however trivial in the
beginning, have in a sense grown with the passing of
time into an importance which calls imperatively for
some manner or form of adjustment."
</p>
<p>
He paused in his speech, as if to control his emotions
and to collect his thoughts. The king leaned forward
and addressed him. "Does any one," he asked, "appear
here for madame the Princess de Gonzague?"
</p>
<p>
Gonzague looked about him with a melancholy
glance. "I had hoped, sire," he said, "that madame
the princess would have chosen some one to represent
her." But even as he spoke he paused, for the door
that led to the princess&#8217;s apartment was thrown open,
and the Princess de Gonzague appeared, clad in black
as usual, and as usual leaning upon the arm of her
faithful Brigitte.
</p>
<p>
As the princess entered the room, every one rose,
and all eyes were fixed upon the stately figure and
melancholy features of the still beautiful, if prematurely
aged, widow of Nevers. The princess made
a deep inclination to the king, and then spoke:
"Your majesty, I need no one to represent me. I
am here."
</p>
<p>
Gonzague allowed his features to betray the satisfaction
he felt at the presence of his consort. He hastened
to advance to her as she seated herself close to
the curtained alcove, saying as he did so: "Madame,
you are indeed welcome." And there was a sincerity
in his tone not always characteristic of his utterances.
</p>
<p>
The king bowed in his courtliest manner to the
unhappy lady, and addressed her: "Princess, you
know why we are assembled here?"
</p>
<p>
Slowly the princess inclined her head. "I do,"
she said, and said no more, but sat looking fixedly
before her, the image of a patience that shielded a
strong purpose and a resignation that was now
kindled by a new hope.
</p>
<p>
The king turned to his friend and host: "Prince
de Gonzague, we await your pleasure."
</p>
<p>
Louis de Gonzague rose to his feet and surveyed
his assembled guests with a grave countenance that
seemed to suggest boldness without effrontery and a
grief nobly borne. All present admired his beauty,
his dignity, the proud humility of his carriage towards
the great lady who was in name his wife. Many
sympathized with him in what they knew to be his
strange position, and felt that the princess was indeed
to blame in refusing friendship and sympathy to such
a man.
</p>
<p>
Gonzague bowed respectfully to the king, and his
eyes travelled over the whole range of his audience
as he spoke. "Sire," he said, "I have to speak to-day
of the sorrow that has haunted me, as it has
haunted your majesty, for seventeen years. Louis de
Lorraine, Duke de Nevers, was my cousin by blood,
my brother by affection. His memory lives here,
eternal as is the grief of his widow, who has not disdained
to wear my name after wearing his."
</p>
<p>
He paused for a moment, and in that pause the
princess spoke in a voice that was shaken with emotion,
in spite of her determination to be firm: "Do
not speak of that. I have passed those seventeen
years in solitude and in tears."
</p>
<p>
Gonzague paid to her and her sorrow the homage
of a bow; then he resumed: "When madame the princess
did me the honor to accept my name, she made
public her secret but legitimate marriage with the
late Duke de Nevers and the birth of a daughter of
that union. This child disappeared on the night of
Nevers&#8217;s death. The registration of its birth is torn
out of the chapel register and lost. For seventeen
years the princess has patiently sought for her lost
child, and has sought in vain."
</p>
<p>
The princess sighed: "Alas!" Gonzague paused for
a moment as if to allow the princess to say more, and
then, seeing she kept silent, he continued: "Calumniators
have hinted that it was my wish that
the child should not be found. Have they not,
madame?"
</p>
<p>
"Such things have been said," the princess replied,
gravely.
</p>
<p>
Again Gonzague spoke: "There were even those
who hinted that my hand might strike at a child&#8217;s life.
Is not that so?"
</p>
<p>
Again the princess repeated her former phrase:
"Such things have been said."
</p>
<p>
Now Gonzague questioned her directly: "And you
believed the accusation?"
</p>
<p>
The princess inclined her head: "I believed it."
</p>
<p>
At this reply a murmur not to be repressed ran
through the assembly. Those that sympathized with
Gonzague before now sympathized more deeply on
hearing such an answer come so coldly from his wife&#8217;s
lips. Gonzague allowed himself the luxury of a little,
patient sigh, the privileged protest of the good
and just under an intolerable suspicion.
</p>
<p>
"I am not surprised. The princess does not know
me. For seventeen years the princess and I have
been strangers. Now, for the first time, I can show
myself to my wife as I am." He addressed himself
directly to the princess: "Through all these seventeen
years I, too, have been seeking what you sought;
but, more fortunate than you, I have succeeded where
you have failed."
</p>
<p>
He turned to Peyrolles, who was standing close to
his master&#8217;s side, and commanded: "Bring in Mademoiselle
Gabrielle de Nevers."
</p>
<p>
In a moment Peyrolles had vanished from the room,
leaving every man in the assembly impressed and
startled by Gonzague&#8217;s statement. The king looked
from Gonzague, whose face he had been studying
while he spoke with admiration and approval, and
fixed his keen gaze upon the princess. She alone, of
all those in the room, seemed unmoved by the momentous
tidings that her husband had communicated.
The younger men whispered among themselves, the
elders kept silence, but it was plain that their curiosity
was very great.
</p>
<p>
In a few moments Peyrolles returned to the room
escorting Flora, now very beautifully attired in a
dress of simple richness.
</p>
<p>
Chavernay could not restrain his surprise as she
entered. "The little dancing-girl," he whispered to
his right-hand neighbor, Choisy, but he said no more.
Even his airy nature was impressed by the stillness
of the company and the gravity of the situation.
</p>
<p>
Gonzague took the hand of Flora and conducted
her across the room to the princess. "Madame," he
said, "I restore your child."
</p>
<p>
The princess looked fixedly at the girl, her thin
hands clasping the arms of her chair convulsively,
and it could be seen that she was trembling from head
to foot. She was waiting for a voice, she was wondering
if she would hear a voice, and as she waited and
wondered she heard a voice from behind the curtain
near where she sat apart, a voice which reached
her ears, a voice with a mysterious message&mdash;"I am
here."
</p>
<p>
The princess clasped her hand to her heart. "Ah!"
she murmured, "will the dead speak? Is this my
child?" And again the voice spoke and answered:
"No."
</p>
<p>
By this time Gonzague and the girl had reached
the princess, who now rose to her feet and confronted
the pair as she spoke. "My child should have with
her a packet containing the page torn away from the
register of the chapel of Caylus, torn away with my
own hands." She turned to Flora and questioned
her: "Have you that packet?"
</p>
<p>
Flora dropped on her knees and stretched out her
hands with a pretty, pathetic air of supplication.
"Madame, I have nothing. Ah, madame, the poor
little gypsy girl asks of you neither wealth nor station;
she only entreats you to love her as she loves
you."
</p>
<p>
The princess prayed silently: "Oh, Heaven help
me! Heaven inspire me!"
</p>
<p>
Gonzague was startled by this sudden hostility to
his scheme, but spoke with respectful earnestness:
"Madame," he said, slowly, "we have depositions,
sworn to and duly attested in Madrid, that this girl,
then a year-old child, was given to a band of gypsies
by a man whose description coincides exactly with
that of one of the men believed to have been concerned
in the attack upon Louis de Nevers in the
moat of Caylus. We have their statements that in
their hearing the man called the child Gabrielle,
that he said to the head gypsy that she was of noble
birth, and that he gave her up to them because he
wished the child to suffer for the hate he bore her
father. All this and more than this we can prove.
For my part, I say that in this girl&#8217;s lineaments I seem
to see again the features of my dear dead friend.
Madame, to reject the child whom we believe to be
the daughter of Nevers, you must have reasons grave
indeed&mdash;the strongest proofs. Have you such reasons,
such proofs?"
</p>
<p>
From behind the curtain a voice travelled to the
princess&#8217;s ears, murmuring, "Yes," and the princess
repeated, "Yes," confidently.
</p>
<p>
Gonzague drew himself up with a look of pain and
sorrow. "I understand, madame. Some impostor,
speculating upon your sorrow, has told you that he
has found your child."
</p>
<p>
Chavernay whispered behind his hand to Navailles:
"Our cousin is losing his temper."
</p>
<p>
As the princess kept silent, Gonzague pressed his
question: "Is that not so, madame? Speak! Is this
not so? Some one has told you that she is alive?"
</p>
<p>
The princess heard the voice behind the curtain
whisper: "She lives." Looking steadily at Gonzague,
she said: "She lives, in spite of you, by the
grace of God."
</p>
<p>
The agitation of the audience was very great. The
king directly addressed the princess: "Can you produce
her?"
</p>
<p>
Again the voice whispered to the Princess, "Yes,"
and again the Princess repeated, "Yes," as confidently
as before.
</p>
<p>
"When?" asked the king, to whom Gonzague had
at once yielded the privilege of question.
</p>
<p>
The voice whispered, "To-night," and the princess
repeated the words.
</p>
<p>
The voice whispered again, "At the ball in the
Palais Royal," and again the Princess echoed it,
"At the ball in the Palais Royal."
</p>
<p>
The king had no more to say; he was silent. Gonzague
groaned aloud as he turned to Flora. "My
poor child, only God can give you back the heart of
your mother."
</p>
<p>
The girl, with the quick impulsiveness of her race,
again flung herself on her knees before the princess,
while she cried: "Madame, whether you are my mother
or not, I respect you, I love you!"
</p>
<p>
The princess laid her hand gently on the girl&#8217;s
dark hair. "My child, my child, I believe you are
no accomplice of this crime. I wish you well."
</p>
<p>
Flora was now sobbing bitterly, and seemed unable
to rise. Peyrolles hastened to her side, hastened to
lift her to her feet, and hurriedly conducted the weeping
girl from the room. The princess, holding her
head high, turned and addressed the king: "Your
majesty, my mourning ends to-day. I have recovered
my daughter. I shall be your guest to-night,
sire."
</p>
<p>
The king bowed profoundly. "Believe that we
shall be most proud to welcome you."
</p>
<p>
The princess made him a reverence and turned to
leave the room. The king quitted his chair, hastened
to her side, and gave her his arm to the door. When
she had departed, Louis of France hastened to Gonzague
where he stood alone, the centre of wondering
eyes. "What is the meaning of this double discovery?"
he asked.
</p>
<p>
Gonzague shook his head with the air of one who
is faced by a shameful conspiracy, but who is not
afraid to face it. "I have found Nevers&#8217;s child. Who
the impostor is I do not know, but I shall know&mdash;and
then&mdash;"
</p>
<p>
He paused, but his menacing silence was more
impressive than any speech. The king wrung his
friend&#8217;s hand warmly. "I hope you may. Till to-night,
gentlemen."
</p>
<p>
All were standing now. The king embraced the
company in a general salutation and went out, followed
by his friends. The lawyers, the ecclesiastics
took their leave. Only the friends of Gonzague
remained in the room, and they stood apart, eying
their master dubiously, uncertain whether he would
wish them to go or to stay. Chavernay took it upon
himself, with his usual lightness of heart, to play
their spokesman. He advanced to Gonzague and
addressed him.
</p>
<p>
"Can we condole with you on this game of cross-purposes?"
</p>
<p>
Gonzague turned to Chavernay, and his countenance
was calm, bold, almost smiling. "No. I shall
win the game. We shall meet to-night. Perhaps I
shall need your swords."
</p>
<p>
"Now, as ever, at your service," Navailles protested,
and the rest murmured their agreement with
the speaker. Then Gonzague&#8217;s partisans slowly filed
out of the room, Chavernay, as usual, smiling, the
others unusually grave. Gonzague turned to Peyrolles,
who had returned from his task of convoying
Flora to her apartments. "Who has done all this?"
he asked.
</p>
<p>
He thought he was alone with his henchman, but
he was mistaken. Æsop had quietly entered the
room, and was standing at his side. Æsop answered
the question addressed to Peyrolles. "I can tell you.
The man you can neither find nor bind."
</p>
<p>
Gonzague started. "Lagardere?"
</p>
<p>
Æsop nodded. "Lagardere, whom I will give into
your hands if you wish."
</p>
<p>
Gonzague caught at his promise eagerly. "When?"
he asked.
</p>
<p>
"To-night, at the king&#8217;s ball," Æsop answered.

<h2>XXIII</h2>
<h3>THE KING&#8217;S BALL</h3>
</div>

<p>
The gardens of the Palais Royal made a delightful
place for such an entertainment as the king&#8217;s
ball. In its contrasts of light and shadow, in its
sombre alleys starred with colored lights, in its blend
of courtly pomp and sylvan simplicity, it seemed the
fairy-like creation of some splendid dream. Against
the vivid greenness of the trees, intensified by the
brightness of the blazing lamps, the whiteness of the
statues asserted itself with fantastic emphasis. Everywhere
innumerable flowers of every hue and every
odor sweetened the air and pleased the eye, and
through the blooming spaces, seemingly as innumerable
as the blossoms and seemingly as brilliant,
moved the gay, many-colored crowd of the king&#8217;s
guests. The gardens were large, the gardens were
spacious, but the king&#8217;s guests were many, and
seemed to leave no foot of room unoccupied. Hither
and thither they drifted, swayed, eddied, laughing,
chattering, intriguing, whispering, admiring, wondering,
playing all the tricks, repeating all the antics
that are the time-honored attributes and privileges
of a masquerade. Here trained dancers executed
some elaborate measure for the entertainment of
those that cared to pause in their wandering and behold
them; there mysterious individuals, in flowing
draperies, professed to read the stars and tell the fortunes
of those that chose to spare some moments
from frivolity for such mystic consultations.
</p>
<p>
In the handsomest part of the garden, hard by the
Pond and Fountain of Diana, a magnificent tent had
been pitched, which was reserved for the accommodation
of the king himself and for such special friends
as he might choose to invite to share his privacy.
Around this tent a stream of mirth-makers flowed
at a respectful distance, envying&mdash;for envy is present
even at a masquerade&mdash;those most highly favored
where all were highly favored in being admitted into
the sovereign&#8217;s intimacy.
</p>
<p>
At the door of this tent, Monsieur Breant, who
had been one of the cardinal&#8217;s principal servants, and
who still remained the head custodian of the palace,
was standing surveying the scene with a curiosity
dulled by long familiarity. He was unaware that a
sombrely clad hunchback, quite an incongruous figure
in the merry crowd, was making for him, until the
hunchback, coming along beside him, touched him on
the arm and called him by name: "Monsieur Breant!"
</p>
<p>
Breant turned and gazed at the hunchback with
some surprise. "Who are you?" he asked.
</p>
<p>
The hunchback laughed as he answered: "Don&#8217;t
you know me? Why, man, I am Æsop the Second.
My illustrious ancestor laughed at all the world, and
so do I. He loved the Greek girl Rhodopis, who built
herself a pyramid. I am wiser than he, for I love
only myself."
</p>
<p>
Breant shrugged his shoulders and made to turn
upon his heel. "I have no time for fooling."
</p>
<p>
Æsop detained him. "Don&#8217;t leave me; I am good
company."
</p>
<p>
Breant did not seem to be tempted by the offer.
"That may be, but I must attend on his majesty."
</p>
<p>
Æsop still restrained him. "You can do me a
favor."
</p>
<p>
Breant eyed the impertinent hunchback with disfavor.
"Why should I do you a favor, Æsop the
Second?"
</p>
<p>
The hunchback explained, gayly: "In the first
place, because I am the guest of his Majesty the King.
In the second place, because I am the confidential
devil of his Highness the Prince de Gonzague. But
my third reason is perhaps better."
</p>
<p>
As he spoke he took a well-filled purse from his
pocket and tossed it lightly from one hand to the other,
looking at Breant with a sneering smile. Breant
would have been no true servant of the time if he
had not liked money for the sake of the pleasure that
money could give; Breant would have been no true
servant of the time if he had not been always in want
of money. He eyed the purse approvingly, and his
manner was more amiable.
</p>
<p>
"What do you want?" he asked.
</p>
<p>
Æsop made his wishes clear. "There is a little
lodge yonder in the darkness at the end of that alley,
hard by the small gate that is seldom used. You
know the gate, for you sometimes used to wait in
that little lodge when a late exalted personage chose
to walk abroad incognito."
</p>
<p>
Breant frowned at him. "You know much, Master
Æsop."
</p>
<p>
Æsop shrugged his shoulders. "I am a wizard.
But it needs no wizard to guess that, as the exalted
personage is no longer with us, he will not walk
abroad to-night, and you will not have to yawn and
doze in the lodge till he return."
</p>
<p>
"What then?" asked Breant.
</p>
<p>
Æsop lowered his voice to a whisper. "Let me
have the key of the little lodge for to-night."
</p>
<p>
Breant lifted his hands in protest. "Impossible!"
he said.
</p>
<p>
Æsop shook his head. "I hate that word, Monsieur
Breant. &#8217;Tis a vile word. Come now, twenty
louis and the key of the lodge for an hour after midnight."
</p>
<p>
Breant looked at the purse and looked at the
hunchback. "Why do you want it?" he asked.
</p>
<p>
Æsop laughed mockingly. "Vanity. I wish to
walk this ball like a gentleman. I have fine clothes;
they lie now in a bundle on the lodge step. If I had
the key I could slip inside and change and change
again and enjoy myself, and no one the worse or the
wiser."
</p>
<p>
The purse seemed to grow larger to Breant&#8217;s eyes,
and his objections to dwindle proportionately. "A
queer whim, crookback," he said.
</p>
<p>
Æsop amended the phrase: "A harmless whim,
and twenty louis would please the pocket."
</p>
<p>
Breant slipped his hand into a side-pocket, and,
producing a little key, he handed it to Æsop.
"There&#8217;s the key, but I must have it back before
morning."
</p>
<p>
Æsop took the key, and the purse changed owners.
"You shall," he promised. "Good. Now I shall
make myself beautiful."
</p>
<p>
Breant looked at him good-humoredly. "Good
sport, Æsop the Second." He turned and disappeared
into the tent.
</p>
<p>
Æsop, looking at the key with satisfaction, murmured
to himself: "The best."
</p>
<p>
As he moved slowly away from the king&#8217;s tent a
little crowd of Gonzague&#8217;s friends&mdash;Chavernay, Oriol,
Navailles, Nocé, Gironne, Choisy, Albret, and Montaubert&mdash;all
laughing and talking loudly, crossed his
path and perceived the hunchback, who seemed to
them, naturally enough, a somewhat singular figure
in such a scene. "Good Heavens! What is this?"
cried Navailles.
</p>
<p>
Nocé chuckled: "A hunchback brings luck. May
I slap you on the back, little lord?"
</p>
<p>
Æsop answered him, coolly: "Yes, Monsieur de
Nocé, if I may slap you in the face."
</p>
<p>
Nocé took offence instantly. "Now, by Heaven,
crookback!" he cried, and made a threatening gesture
against Æsop, who eyed him insolently with a
mocking smile.
</p>
<p>
Chavernay interposed. "Nonsense!" he cried.
"Nonsense, Nocé, you began the jest." Then he
added, in a lower voice: "You can&#8217;t pick a quarrel
with the poor devil."
</p>
<p>
The hunchback paid him an extravagant salutation.
"Monsieur de Chavernay, you are always chivalrous.
You really ought to die young, for it will take so
much trouble to turn you into a rogue."
</p>
<p>
Fat Oriol, staring in amazement at the controversy,
questioned: "What does the fellow mean?"
</p>
<p>
Chavernay burst into a fit of laughing, and patted
Oriol on the back. "I&#8217;m afraid he means that you
are a rogue, Oriol."
</p>
<p>
While the angry gentlemen stood together, with
the hunchback apart eying them derisively, and
Chavernay standing between the belligerents as peace-maker,
Taranne hurriedly joined the group. He was
evidently choking with news and eager to distribute
it.
</p>
<p>
"Friends, friends," he cried, "there is something
extraordinary going on here to-night!"
</p>
<p>
"What is it?" asked Chavernay.
</p>
<p>
Taranne answered him, with a voice as grave as an
oracle: "All the sentinels are doubled, and there are
two companies of soldiers in the great court."
</p>
<p>
Navailles protested: "You are joking!"
</p>
<p>
Taranne was not to be put down. "Never more
serious. Every one who enters is scrutinized most
carefully."
</p>
<p>
"That is easy to explain," said Chavernay; "it is
just to make sure that they really are invited."
</p>
<p>
Taranne declined to admit this interpretation of
his mystery: "Not so, for nobody is allowed on any
pretext to leave the gardens."
</p>
<p>
Oriol flushed with a sudden wave of intelligence:
"Perhaps some plot against his majesty."
</p>
<p>
"Heaven knows," Navailles commented.
</p>
<p>
Æsop interrupted the discussion with a dry laugh,
dimly suggestive of the cackle of a jackdaw. "I
know, gentlemen."
</p>
<p>
Oriol stared at him. "You know?"
</p>
<p>
Nocé gave vent to an angry laugh. "The hunchback
knows."
</p>
<p>
While this conversation was going on a group of
middle-aged gentlemen had been moving down the
avenue that led to the Pond of Diana. These were
the Baron de la Hunaudaye, Monsieur de Marillac,
Monsieur de Barbanchois, Monsieur de la Ferte, and
Monsieur de Vauguyon. They had been taking a
peaceful interest in the spectacle afforded them, had
been comparing it with similar festivities that they
recalled in the days of their youth, and had been enjoying
themselves tranquilly enough. Perceiving a
group of young men apparently engaged in animated
discussion, the elders quickened their pace a little to
join the party and learn the cause of its animation.
</p>
<p>
When they arrived Æsop was speaking. "Something
extraordinary is going on here to-night, Monsieur
de Navailles. The king is preoccupied. The
guard is doubled, but no one knows why, not even
these gentlemen. But I know, Æsop the Wise."
</p>
<p>
"What do you know?" asked Navailles.
</p>
<p>
Æsop looked at him mockingly. "You would
never guess it if you guessed for a thousand years.
It has nothing to do with plots or politics, with foreign
intrigues or domestic difficulties&mdash;"
</p>
<p>
Oriol thirsted for information. "What is it for,
then?"
</p>
<p>
Æsop answered, gravely, with an amazing question:
"Gentlemen, do you believe in ghosts?" And
the gravity of his voice and the strangeness of his
question forced his hearers, surprised and uneasy,
in spite of themselves, to laugh disdainfully.
</p>
<p>
Æsop accepted their laughter composedly. "Of
course not. No one believes in ghosts at noonday,
on the crowded street, though perhaps some do at
midnight when the world is over-still. But here, to-night,
in all this glitter and crowd and noise and color,
the king is perturbed and the guards are doubled
because of a ghost&mdash;the ghost of a man who has been
dead these seventeen years."
</p>
<p>
The Baron de la Hunaudaye, bluff old soldier of the
brave days of the dawning reign, was interested in the
hunchback&#8217;s words. "Of whom do you speak?" he
asked.
</p>
<p>
Æsop turned to the new-comers, and addressed
them more respectfully than he had been addressing
the partisans of Gonzague: "I speak of a gallant
gentleman&mdash;young, brave, beautiful, well-beloved. I
speak to men who knew him. To you, Monsieur de
la Hunaudaye, who would now be lying under Flemish
earth if his sword had not slain your assailant; to
you, Monsieur de Marillac, whose daughter took the
veil for love of him; to you, Monsieur de Barbanchois,
who fortified against him the dwelling of your lady
love; to you, Monsieur de la Ferte, who lost to him
one evening your Castle of Senneterre; to you, Monsieur
de Vauguyon, whose shoulder should still remember
the stroke of his sword."
</p>
<p>
As Æsop spoke, he addressed in turn each of the
elder men, and as he spoke recognition of his meaning
showed itself in the face of each man whom he addressed.
</p>
<p>
Hunaudaye nodded. "Louis de Nevers," he said,
solemnly.
</p>
<p>
Instantly Æsop uncovered. "Yes, Louis de Nevers,
who was assassinated under the walls of the Castle of
Caylus twenty years ago."
</p>
<p>
Chavernay came over to Æsop. "My father was
a friend of Louis de Nevers."
</p>
<p>
Æsop looked from the group of old men to the group
of young men. "It is the ghost of Nevers that
troubles us to-night. There were three Louis in
those days, brothers in arms. Louis of France did
all he could to find the assassin of Nevers. In vain.
Louis de Gonzague did all he could to find the assassin
of Nevers. In vain. Well, gentlemen, would you believe
it, to-night Louis of France and Louis de Gonzague
will be told the name of the assassin of Nevers?"
</p>
<p>
"And the name?" asked Chavernay.
</p>
<p>
Choisy plucked him impatiently by the sleeve.
"Don&#8217;t you see that the humpbacked fool is making
game of us?"
</p>
<p>
Æsop shrugged his shoulders. "As you please,
sirs, as you please; but that is why the guards are
doubled."
</p>
<p>
He turned on his heel, and walked leisurely away
from the two groups of gentlemen. The elders, having
little in common with Gonzague&#8217;s friends, followed
his example, and drifted off together, talking to one
another in a low voice of the gallant gentleman whose
name had suddenly been recalled to their memories
at that moment. Gonzague&#8217;s gang stared at one another,
feeling vaguely discomfited.
</p>
<p>
"The man is mad," said Gironne.
</p>
<p>
"There seems a method in his madness," said Chavernay,
dryly.
</p>
<p>
Albret interrupted them. "Here comes his majesty."
</p>
<p>
"And, as I live, with the Princess de Gonzague!"
Montaubert cried, amazed.
</p>
<p>
Oriol elevated his fat palms. "Wonders will never
cease!"

<h3>THE ROSE-COLORED DOMINO</h3>
</div>

<p>
All the party bowed respectfully as the king
came slowly down the great walk, giving his arm
to the Princess de Gonzague. Then, anxious to avoid
any appearance of intruding upon the privacy of the
monarch, they drifted off in search of fresh amusement.
</p>
<p>
Louis addressed the princess, indicating the gayety
around him with a wave of his arm. "After so long
an absence from the world, all this folly must worry
you a little."
</p>
<p>
The princess looked at him sadly. "The world and
I have little more to say to each other. I come here
to-night to meet one who has promised to tell me of
my husband, of my child."
</p>
<p>
"Lagardere?" said the king, gravely.
</p>
<p>
And as gravely the princess answered: "Lagardere."
</p>
<p>
"At midnight?" asked the king.
</p>
<p>
"Yes," said the princess.
</p>
<p>
The king looked at his watch. It was half-past
eleven. "Will you rest in my pavilion, princess,
until the time comes?"
</p>
<p>
Louis conducted the princess into the tent, where
he was followed by his escort. As they did so, Gonzague,
coming slowly down the avenue, watched them
thoughtfully. It was strange, indeed, to see his wife
in such a place and in such company. It was strange
to feel that her passive hostility through all these
years was now turned suddenly into action.
</p>
<p>
"Bah!" he said to himself; "it is my word against
that of an adventurer who has hidden for twenty
years."
</p>
<p>
Peyrolles, pushing his way through the crowd and
peering to right and left, caught sight of his master
and hurriedly joined him. "Well," said Gonzague,
"have you found the girl?"
</p>
<p>
Peyrolles made a gesture of despair. "We have
searched Paris without success. Not a sign of her,
nor of him."
</p>
<p>
Gonzague frowned. "She must be here. If she
be the real child, the princess may recognize her."
</p>
<p>
"And all is lost," said Peyrolles, with a groan.
</p>
<p>
Gonzague almost smiled. "No. We will charge
Lagardere with having assassinated the father and
stolen the child for his own ends. He shall be hanged
out of hand. Doña Flora will seem the commendable
error of my over-zealous heart, and as for the new
princess&mdash;well, even princesses are mortal."
</p>
<p>
Peyrolles had always admired his master, but never
perhaps so much as now. "Your Excellency is a man
of genius," he said, enthusiastically.
</p>
<p>
Gonzague smiled. "Forethought, my good Peyrolles&mdash;only
forethought. But it would save trouble
if the girl were out of the way."
</p>
<p>
Peyrolles bowed. "I will do my best, monseigneur."
</p>
<p>
"Good," said Gonzague. "I must wait upon his
majesty. And upon the princess," he added.
</p>
<p>
Gonzague, whose intimacy with the king always
made him the first to be bidden to any special festivity,
entered the tent unchallenged, and was warmly
welcomed by Louis. Peyrolles remained outside,
walking up and down, immersed in distasteful reflections.
He had failed to find the girl; he had failed
to get on the traces of Lagardere; he had seen nothing
of Æsop. The ball, so pleasant to everybody
else, seemed to him full of menace, and he eyed with
some disapproval the jolly, noisy folk that thronged
the alleys and shook the night with laughter. Swollen
with sour humors, he leaned against a tree, cursing
in his heart the folly of those swordsmen who had
failed to get rid of a cursed enemy. Enveloped, as
it were, in bitterness, he failed to notice a not unnoticeable
group that detached itself from the crowd
beyond and came slowly down the alley towards the
Fountain of Diana. The group was composed of a
woman in a rose-colored domino and mask, accompanied
by two tall, masculine figures muffled from
head to heels in black dominos, and their features
completely hidden by bearded black masks. The
pink domino and the twin black dominos seemed
to be seeking their way.
</p>
<p>
"This," said the bigger of the black dominos, and
his voice was the voice of Cocardasse&mdash;"this must be
the Fountain of Diana."
</p>
<p>
The second of the black dominos pointed to the
statue shining in the many-tinted water, and spoke
with the voice of Passepoil: "There&#8217;s some such
poor heathen body."
</p>
<p>
The woman in the rose-pink domino turned to
Cocardasse and asked: "Is Henri here?" And her
voice was the voice of Gabrielle.
</p>
<p>
"I don&#8217;t see him yet, mademoiselle," Cocardasse
answered.
</p>
<p>
Gabrielle sighed. "I wish he were come. All this
noise and glitter bewilder me." And the trio proceeded
slowly to make the tour of the fountain.
</p>
<p>
But if Peyrolles, propped against his tree, was too
preoccupied to notice the not unnoticeable group,
light-hearted Chavernay was more alert. Drifting,
as every one drifted that night, again and again, towards
the Fountain of Diana as the centre of festivity,
he turned to Navailles and pointed to Gabrielle.
"Who is that mask in the rose-colored domino? She
seems to seek some one."
</p>
<p>
Navailles laughed. "She goes about with two
giants like some princess in a fairy tale."
</p>
<p>
Nocé was prepared with an explanation. "It is
Mademoiselle de Clermont, who is looking for me."
</p>
<p>
Taranne pooh-poohed him. "Nonsense. It is Madame
de Tessy, who is looking for me."
</p>
<p>
"It might be Mademoiselle Nivelle, looking for
me," Oriol suggested, fatuously.
</p>
<p>
Choisy, Gironne, Albret, Montaubert&mdash;each in turn
offered a possible name for the unknown.
</p>
<p>
Chavernay would have none of their suggestions.
"No, no. That is not any one we know. She is
neither court lady nor a play actress; she is some
goddess in disguise, and I am going to reveal divinity."
</p>
<p>
Then he tripped daintily forward and intercepted
Gabrielle and her companions as they accomplished
their first tour of the pond. "Fair lady," said Chavernay,
with a graceful bow, "are you looking for
some one?"
</p>
<p>
The large arm of Cocardasse was interposed between
Chavernay and Gabrielle, and the large voice
of Cocardasse counselled Chavernay: "Stand aside,
little man."
</p>
<p>
Quite indifferent to the counsels of the mighty
mask, Chavernay persisted: "Fair lady, dismiss this
monster and accept my arm."
</p>
<p>
This time it was Passepoil&#8217;s turn to intervene.
"Out of the way!" he commanded, and gave Chavernay
a little push.
</p>
<p>
Instantly Chavernay&#8217;s hot blood was in a flame,
and he clapped his hand to his sword. "How dare
you, fellow&mdash;" he began.
</p>
<p>
But now Gabrielle, greatly alarmed at the prospect
of a brawl in such a place, and perfectly recognizing
the marquis, removed her mask from her face
for a moment while she spoke: "Monsieur de Chavernay,
you will let me pass."
</p>
<p>
It was only for a moment, but it was long enough
to give Chavernay time to recognize her, and he
fell back with a respectful salutation. It was long
enough, also, for Peyrolles, leaning against his tree
and at last roused from saddened thoughts to contemplation
of the outer world, to get a glimpse of the
girl&#8217;s face and to recognize its extraordinary resemblance
to the dead duke. He gave a start of surprise.
Was fortune playing into his hands, after all?
</p>
<p>
Chavernay bowed. "Your pardon, lady; your path
is free," he said, and stood aside while Gabrielle
moved slowly forward with her escort on a second
tour of the fountain. Navailles and the others had
seen, indeed, the lady unmask, but were not near
enough to descry her features.
</p>
<p>
"Well," said Navailles, eagerly, to Chavernay&mdash;"well,
who was the lady?"
</p>
<p>
Chavernay answered, coolly: "I do not know."
</p>
<p>
At this moment the lean form and yellow face of
Monsieur de Peyrolles intruded itself into the group
of Gonzague&#8217;s friends.
</p>
<p>
"Monsieur de Chavernay," he said, "my illustrious
master is looking for you. He is with his
majesty."
</p>
<p>
"I will join him," Chavernay answered, readily.
He was, like his kinsman, a privileged person with
the sovereign, and he, too, was permitted to enter
the tent unchallenged. He entered it with a graver
demeanor than he had worn that evening, for he was
strangely perplexed by the presence at the king&#8217;s
ball this night of the girl whom he had seen at the
country Inn. As soon as Chavernay had disappeared,
Peyrolles, hurriedly beckoning, gathered about him
Navailles, Nocé, and the others, and addressed them
in an eager whisper:
</p>
<p>
"Gentlemen, you are all devoted to the interests
of the Prince de Gonzague?"
</p>
<p>
Nocé spoke for himself and his comrades: "We are."
</p>
<p>
Peyrolles went on: "Then, as you value his friendship,
secure the person of that girl whom Monsieur
de Chavernay spoke to just now."
</p>
<p>
"Why?" Navailles questioned.
</p>
<p>
Peyrolles answered him, sharply: "Don&#8217;t ask; act.
To please our master it should be done at once."
</p>
<p>
"How is it to be done?" asked Taranne.
</p>
<p>
Peyrolles looked about him. "Is there no other
woman here who wears a rose-colored domino?"
</p>
<p>
Navailles pointed to a group in an adjacent arbor.
"Cidalise, yonder, is wearing a rose-colored domino.
She will do anything for me."
</p>
<p>
"Bring her," Peyrolles said, in a tone of command
which he sometimes assumed when he was on his
master&#8217;s business, and which no one of his master&#8217;s
friends ever took it upon himself to resent. Navailles
went towards the arbor and came back with Cidalise
upon his arm. Cidalise was a pretty, young actress,
wearing just such a pink domino as that worn by
Gabrielle.
</p>
<p>
Navailles formally presented her to Peyrolles.
"Monsieur Peyrolles, this is the divine Cidalise.
What do you want of her?"
</p>
<p>
Peyrolles unceremoniously took the actress by the
wrist, and pointed to where Gabrielle and her escort
were wandering.
</p>
<p>
"You see that girl in rose-color, escorted by two
giants? Your friends will gather about them and
begin to hustle the giants. In the confusion you
will slip between the pair, who will then be left to
march off, believing that you are their charge, who
will, however, be in the care of these gentlemen. Do
you understand?"
</p>
<p>
Cidalise nodded. "Perfectly. And if I do this?"
</p>
<p>
"You may rely upon the generosity of the Prince
of Gonzague," Peyrolles answered. If he said little,
he looked much, and Cidalise understood him as she
accepted.
</p>
<p>
"It will be rare sport. Come, gentlemen."
</p>
<p>
By this time Gabrielle and her companions, having
completed their second circumnavigation of the
pond, were going slowly across the open space again.
The crowd was very great about them, the noise
and laughter made everything confused. Gonzague&#8217;s
friends took advantage of the crowd and the confusion.
They huddled around Gabrielle and her
escort, laughing and chattering volubly. They hustled
Cocardasse, they hustled Passepoil, treading on
their toes and tweaking their elbows, much to the
indignation of the Gascon and the Norman, each of
whom tried angrily and unavailingly to get hold of one
of his nimble tormentors. In the jostling and confusion,
Cidalise slipped neatly between the two bravos,
suddenly abandoned by their plaguers; while Gabrielle,
surrounded by the dexterous gentlemen, was, against
her will but very steadily, edged towards a side alley.
Cocardasse and Passepoil, drawing deep breaths such
as Io may have drawn when freed from her gadfly,
looked down and saw, as they believed, Gabrielle
standing between them. The seeming Gabrielle moved
on, on a third journey round the Pond of Diana,
and her escort accompanied her, confident that all
was well.
</p>
<p>
In the mean time, Gabrielle was appealing to the
gentlemen who surrounded her. "Gentlemen, stand
aside!" she said, in a tone partly of entreaty, partly
of command.
</p>
<p>
At that moment Peyrolles came to her side and
saluted her respectfully. "Do not be alarmed. We
come from him."
</p>
<p>
Gabrielle stared in amazement at the unfamiliar face.
</p>
<p>
Peyrolles bent to her ear and whispered: "From
Lagardere."
</p>
<p>
Gabrielle gave a cry. "Ah! Where is he?"
</p>
<p>
Peyrolles pointed to the far end of the alley in
which they were standing. It was a dimmer alley
than the others, for, in obedience to a suggestion
of Peyrolles, Oriol had been busily engaged in putting
out the lights. "At the end of this alley. He is
waiting for you."
</p>
<p>
He offered her his arm as he spoke, and Gabrielle,
believing indeed that Lagardere had sent for her,
accepted his guidance down the alley, and so she
disappeared from the noise and mirth and light and
color of the royal ball.
</p>
<p>
As the domino in pink and the dominos in black
completed their third turn round the Fountain of
Diana, the domino in pink plucked off her mask, and,
looking up at her accompanying giants, showed to
them, amazed, the pretty, impudent, unfamiliar face
of Cidalise. "May I ask, gentlemen, why you follow
me?" she said, merrily.
</p>
<p>
At the sight of her face, at the sound of her voice,
at her question, Cocardasse and Passepoil reeled as if
they had been struck. Cidalise went on: "I have many
friends here, and no need for your company." Then
she laughed and ran away out of sight in a moment
in the shifting crowd, leaving Cocardasse and Passepoil
staring at each other in staggered amazement.
</p>
<p>
"The devil!" said Cocardasse.
</p>
<p>
"That&#8217;s what I&#8217;m thinking," said Passepoil.
</p>
<p>
Cocardasse groaned. "What will Lagardere say?"
</p>
<p>
"Well, we did our best," Passepoil sighed.
</p>
<p>
Cocardasse groaned again. "What&#8217;s the good, if
we didn&#8217;t do what he wanted?"
</p>
<p>
"Where shall we find him?" asked Passepoil.
</p>
<p>
Cocardasse consulted the watch which he owed to the
bounty of the Prince de Gonzague. "He will be here at
midnight. It is nearly that now. Come, man, come."
And the baffled, bewildered, angry pair plunged despairingly
into the thickness of the crowd about them,
hoping against hope to find their lost charge for the
moment when Lagardere was to make his appearance.

<h3>THE GLOVE OF COCARDASSE</h3>
</div>

<p>
For a little longer the noise and revelry continued,
until the moment came when the king&#8217;s
hospitality, offering supper to his wearied guests,
emptied the gardens of many of their frequenters.
Inside his tent the sovereign was supping with his
friends. By his side sat the Princess de Gonzague,
who neither ate nor drank, but waited with an aching
heart for midnight. At a quarter to twelve Bonnivet
entered the tent and advanced towards the king.
</p>
<p>
"Sire," he said, "there is a gentleman here who
insists on immediate speech with you. He says you
have appointed this time and place to meet him."
</p>
<p>
Louis turned to the Princess de Gonzague, whose
pale face had suddenly flushed. "It is he," he said;
and then turned to Bonnivet. "Introduce the gentleman."
</p>
<p>
Bonnivet went to the entrance of the tent, and a
moment later Lagardere entered. He was wearing
his old white coat of the Royal Light-Horse, and he
advanced composedly, with head erect, towards the
king.
</p>
<p>
"I am here," he said, as he saluted the duke, and
all present gazed on him with curiosity. Only three
knew who he was or why he was there.
</p>
<p>
Gonzague muttered to himself: "Now for the death-struggle."
</p>
<p>
The king looked at his visitor. "Who are you?"
he asked.
</p>
<p>
And Lagardere answered: "I am Henri de Lagardere."
</p>
<p>
At that moment Peyrolles, privileged as his master&#8217;s
henchman, entered the tent and made his way
to Gonzague&#8217;s side. "All is well," he whispered.
"We have got the girl, and the papers are upon her."
</p>
<p>
The king was addressing Lagardere. "You are
here at our pleasure&mdash;free to come, free to go, free
to speak."
</p>
<p>
Lagardere answered, firmly: "I mean to speak."
</p>
<p>
The princess turned to him. "Will you give me
back my daughter?"
</p>
<p>
Lagardere made her a bow. "In a few moments
she will be in your arms."
</p>
<p>
At this moment Gonzague rose and interrupted.
"Sire," he said, "I can tell you something of this
man."
</p>
<p>
Lagardere glanced scornfully at Gonzague. "Sire,"
he said, "I can tell you something of this man." He
advanced towards Gonzague and addressed him in
a low tone: "On that September night I told you
that if you did not come to Lagardere, Lagardere
would come to you. You did not come. I am here."
Then he turned to the princess. "Madame, here, as
in the moat of Caylus Castle; here, as by the picture
in your palace, I am wholly in your service."
</p>
<p>
Gonzague turned to the king with an appealing
gesture. "I implore your majesty to let no one leave
this place. If Monsieur de Lagardere is desirous of
darkness and mystery, I ask only for light and
truth."
</p>
<p>
The king spoke, decisively: "If the attack has been
secret, the justification shall be public."
</p>
<p>
Gonzague addressed Lagardere: "Where is the
woman who calls herself the daughter of Louis de
Nevers?"
</p>
<p>
The king also questioned: "Why is she not with
you?"
</p>
<p>
Lagardere answered, composedly: "Mademoiselle
de Nevers will be here at midnight, and will herself
present to your Royal Highness the papers that
prove her birth."
</p>
<p>
"What papers?" asked the king.
</p>
<p>
And Lagardere answered: "The pages torn from
the parish register by her mother, and confided to
me in the moat of Caylus Castle."
</p>
<p>
The princess leaned forward. "What do you say?"
she asked, eagerly, and the king echoed her question.
</p>
<p>
Lagardere replied: "The princess gave those papers
to me when she placed her child in my arms, believing
that I was her husband, Louis de Nevers."
</p>
<p>
Gonzague questioned, with a sneer: "Why should
she think you were her husband?"
</p>
<p>
Lagardere looked him full in the face. "Because,
thanks to you, I gave the signal agreed upon&mdash;her
husband&#8217;s motto, &#8217;I am here.&#8217;"
</p>
<p>
The princess clasped her hands. "My God, sire,
it is true."
</p>
<p>
"And these papers are in your hands?" the king
asked.
</p>
<p>
Lagardere answered, quietly: "They are in the
hands of Mademoiselle de Nevers."
</p>
<p>
Gonzague looked triumphantly from Lagardere to
the king. "Then why is this pretended Mademoiselle
de Nevers not here?"
</p>
<p>
Lagardere replied, composedly: "She is to be here
at midnight."
</p>
<p>
Gonzague looked at his watch. "It is midnight
now&mdash;she is not here. Your majesty sees the worth
of this man&#8217;s word."
</p>
<p>
Louis gazed curiously at Lagardere, whose bearing,
in spite of the king&#8217;s prejudices as a friend of Gonzague,
impressed him as that of an honest man. "Had
you not better send for this lady?" he questioned.
</p>
<p>
On Lagardere&#8217;s face now some anxiety was depicted,
and he answered, anxiously: "She will be here; she
must be here. Ah!"
</p>
<p>
In the excitement consequent upon the extraordinary
scene that was passing in the king&#8217;s presence,
the attention of all the guests was riveted upon their
host and upon the amazing altercation between Louis
of Gonzague and the unknown adventurer, and the
entrance of the tent was left unheeded and unguarded.
At this moment the curtains were parted, and the
figure of Cocardasse appeared for a moment in the
opening. As Lagardere saw him, Cocardasse lifted
his glove in the air and let it fall to the ground. Then,
in a moment, he had vanished before any one had noticed
the episode.
</p>
<p>
Lagardere gave a sharp cry of pain as he turned to
the princess. "Madame, your child is not here; your
child must be in danger!" he cried.
</p>
<p>
The princess clasped her hands as she cried: "My
child! My child!"
</p>
<p>
Gonzague pointed mockingly at Lagardere. "The
impostor is already exposed!" he cried, exultingly.
</p>
<p>
Lagardere turned towards him, fiercely. "Liar! assassin!"
he cried, and advanced towards Gonzague,
but was stopped by Bonnivet.
</p>
<p>
The king looked at him sternly. "Sir, you have
made charges you could not prove, promises you could
not keep. You shall answer for this before your
judges."
</p>
<p>
Bonnivet made as if to arrest Lagardere, but Lagardere
held up his hand. "Stop!" he cried; "let no
man dare to touch me. I have here your majesty&#8217;s
safe-conduct, signed and sealed&mdash;&#8217;free to come, free to
go&#8217;&mdash;that was your promise, sire."
</p>
<p>
Gonzague protested. "A promise won by a trick
does not count."
</p>
<p>
The king shook his head. "I have given my word.
The man has forty-eight hours to cross the frontier."
</p>
<p>
Lagardere bowed to the king. "I thank you,
sire. You are a true and honorable gentleman. But,
sire, I give you back your word." As he spoke he
tore the safe-conduct in two and flung it at his feet.
"I ask but four-and-twenty hours to unmask the
villain who now triumphs over truth and justice, and
to give back a daughter to her mother. Nevers shall
be avenged! Make way for me!"
</p>
<p>
As he spoke he turned upon his heel and passed
rapidly from the king&#8217;s presence, the amazed and
bewildered guests giving ground before him as he
passed. Instantly Gonzague turned and whispered to
Peyrolles: "He must not leave this place alive."
</p>
<p>
And Peyrolles answered, confidently: "He shall not.
Every gate is guarded by my spies."
</p>
<p>
The king rose gravely and addressed the assembly.
"Let us disperse, friends. What we have seen and
heard leaves us in little mood for merrymaking."
Then he gave his hand to the now weeping princess,
and, followed by his immediate escort, quitted the
tent. It was soon deserted; it was soon empty. The
king departed in the direction of his palace. News
that the ball was ended spread rapidly, and in a short
while the gardens that had been so thronged and brilliant
became deserted and desolate. The departing
guests found that every exit was guarded by soldiers,
and that their faces were carefully scanned before they
were suffered to leave the precincts of the Palais Royal.
</p>
<p>
Gonzague remained alone in the solitude by the
Fountain of Diana, waiting for Peyrolles, who presently
joined him.
</p>
<p>
"Well?" Gonzague asked, anxiously.
</p>
<p>
Peyrolles looked disappointed. "He has not left
by any of the gates. He must be hiding in the gardens."
</p>
<p>
Gonzague commanded, sharply: "Bid your men
seek till they find, and kill when they find."
</p>
<p>
Peyrolles bowed. "Yes, your excellency," he said,
and disappeared down one of the silent alleys. As he
departed, the hunchback emerged from the shadow
of a tree and approached Gonzague noiselessly. Gonzague
started a little as he suddenly became aware of
the hunchback&#8217;s presence.
</p>
<p>
The hunchback bowed. "Is your highness content
with the night&#8217;s work?"
</p>
<p>
"So far, yes," Gonzague replied. "We have got
the girl and got the papers safe in my palace."
</p>
<p>
"Ah! And Lagardere?" the hunchback asked.
</p>
<p>
Gonzague answered: "Peyrolles is looking for him,
with six of the best swords in Paris."
</p>
<p>
Æsop spoke, contemptuously: "Peyrolles is a bungler.
Leave it to me. I will find Lagardere for you
and deal with him as he deserves before an hour has
passed."
</p>
<p>
Gonzague caught at his words eagerly. "You
promise?"
</p>
<p>
Æsop answered, proudly: "On the word of a hunchback.
Before two o&#8217;clock I will bring you the news
you wish for."
</p>
<p>
Gonzague gave a cry of triumph. "Then ask and
have your own reward." Then he turned and hurriedly
left the gardens, his breast swelled with exultation.
When he was out of sight, the hunchback
whistled softly, and Cocardasse and Passepoil came
out of the shadow of the trees. The lights were now
rapidly dying out, and the gardens lay in darkness
checkered by the moonlight.
</p>
<p>
Lagardere turned to his friends. "She is in Gonzague&#8217;s
palace. We must rescue her at once."
</p>
<p>
Passepoil appealed to him, pathetically: "Can you
ever forgive us?"
</p>
<p>
"Yes," Lagardere answered&mdash;"yes, on one condition.
There is a snake in this garden. Kill him for
me."
</p>
<p>
Cocardasse gave a grin of appreciation. "Peyrolles
it is."
</p>
<p>
Even as he spoke there was a tramp of feet and
a flare of light in a side alley, and Peyrolles came towards
them followed by half a dozen men, each of
whom carried a torch in his left hand and a naked
sword in his right. Peyrolles came towards the
hunchback.
</p>
<p>
"Well, Æsop, we cannot find him anywhere."
</p>
<p>
"That," the hunchback answered, coldly, "is because
you don&#8217;t know where to look."
</p>
<p>
Peyrolles turned to his followers. "Seek in all
directions," he said, and the men with the swords
and torches dispersed in twos down the adjacent
alleys.
</p>
<p>
The hunchback laid his hand on Peyrolles&#8217;s shoulder.
"I know where to find him."
</p>
<p>
Peyrolles turned in astonishment. "You do?"
</p>
<p>
"I am here!" the hunchback said, sternly. He
drew himself up erect and menacing, and flung back
the long hair from his face. Peyrolles gave a gasp
of horror as he recognized the man whom he had seen
such a short while before in the presence of the
king.
</p>
<p>
"Lagardere!" he cried, and was about to scream
for help when Cocardasse grasped him by the throat.
There was a short struggle, and then Cocardasse flung
the dead body of Peyrolles at the feet of Lagardere.
</p>
<p>
Lagardere bent over him and spoke his epitaph:
"The last of the lackeys. Now for the master."

<h3>THE REWARD OF ÆSOP</h3>
</div>

<p>
Paris lay quiet enough between the midnight
and the dawn. All the noise and brilliance and
turbulence, all the gayety and folly and fancy of the
royal ball had died away and left the Palais Royal
and the capital to peace. Little waves of frivolity
had drifted this way and that from the ebbing sea to
the haven of this great house and that great house,
where certain of those that had made merry in the
king&#8217;s gardens now made merrier still at a supper as
of the gods. The Palace of Gonzague was one of those
great houses. The hall where the Three Louis gazed
at one another&mdash;one so brave, one so comely, one so
royal&mdash;was indeed a brilliant solitude where the lights
of many candles illuminated only the painted canvases
throned over emptiness. But from behind the
great gilded doors came the sound of many voices,
men&#8217;s voices and women&#8217;s voices, full of mirth and
the clatter of glasses. His Highness Prince Louis
de Gonzague was entertaining at supper a chosen
company of friends&mdash;flowers from the king&#8217;s garland
carefully culled. There were the brilliant, insolent
youths, who formed the party of Gonzague; there were
the light, bright, desirable women whom the party
of Gonzague especially favored among the many of
their kind in Paris. Nocé was there, and Oriol and
Taranne and Navailles and the others, and the dainty,
daring, impudent Cidalise and her sisters of the
opera, and Oriol&#8217;s flame, who made game of him&mdash;all
very pretty, all very greedy, as greedy of food and
wine as they were greedy of gold and kisses, and all
very merry. One face was wanting from the habitual
familiars of Gonzague. The little, impertinent Marquis
de Chavernay was not present. Gonzague had
not thought fit to include him in the chosen of that
night. Chavernay was getting to be too critical of
his kinsman&#8217;s conduct. Chavernay was not as sympathetic
with his kinsman&#8217;s ambitions and wishes as
his kinsman would have had him be.
</p>
<p>
At the head of the table sat the illustrious host,
beaming with an air of joyousness that astonished
even his friends. It was as though the sun that had
shone for so long upon all their lives, and in whose
light and heat they had prospered, had suddenly taken
upon himself a braver radiance, a fiercer effulgence, in
the glow of which they all, men and women alike,
seemed to feel their personal fortunes patently flourishing.
No one knew why Louis de Gonzague was so
gladsome that night; no one, of course, ventured to
ask the reason of his gayety. It was enough for those,
his satellites, who prospered by his favor and who
battened on his bounty that the prince, who was their
leader, chose on this occasion to show a spirit of careless
mirth that made the thought of serving him, and
of gaining by that service, more than ever attractive.
</p>
<p>
Outside, in the deserted hall, the Three Louis stared
at one another, heedless of the laughter behind the
gilded doors, indifferent to the hilarity, regardless of
the license characteristic of a supper-party in such a
house at such an hour. For long enough the Three
Louis kept one another company, while the great
wax candles dwindled slowly, and the noise and
laughter beyond seemed interminable. Then the door
of the antechamber opened, and the hunchback entered
the hall and paused for a moment, glancing at
each of the Three Louis, with a look of love for one,
a look of hate for the other, and a look of homage
for the third. At the hunchback&#8217;s heels came Cocardasse
and Passepoil, waiting on events. The hunchback
stood for a moment listening to the noise and
jollity beyond the doors. Then he turned to his followers:
</p>
<p>
"My enemy makes merry to-night. I think I shall
take the edge off his merriment by-and-by. But the
trick has its risks, and we hazard our lives. Would
you like to leave the game? I can play it alone."
</p>
<p>
Cocardasse answered with his favorite salute: "I
am with you in this if it ends in the gallows."
</p>
<p>
Passepoil commented: "That&#8217;s my mind."
</p>
<p>
Lagardere looked at them as one looks at friends
who act in accordance with one&#8217;s expectation of them.
</p>
<p>
"Thanks, friends," he said. Then he sat at Gonzague&#8217;s
table, dipped pen in ink, and wrote two hurried
letters. One he handed to Cocardasse. "This
letter to the king, instantly." The other he handed
to Passepoil. "This to Gonzague&#8217;s notary, instantly.
Come back and wait in the anteroom. When you
hear me cry out, &#8217;Lagardere, I am here,&#8217; into the
room and out with your swords for the last chance
and the last fight."
</p>
<p>
Cocardasse laid his hand on the sham hump of the
sham Æsop. "Courage, comrade, the devil is dead."
</p>
<p>
Lagardere laughed at him, something wistfully.
"Not yet."
</p>
<p>
Passepoil suggested, timidly: "We live in hopes."
</p>
<p>
Then Cocardasse and Passepoil went out through
the antechamber, and Lagardere remained alone
with the Three Louis. He rose again and looked at
them each in turn, and his mind was hived with
memories as he gazed. Before Louis de Nevers he
thought of those old days in Paris when the name of
the fair and daring duke was on the lips of all men
and of all women, and when he met him for the first
time and got his lesson in the famous thrust, and
when he met him for the second and last time in the
moat at Caylus and gave him the pledge of brotherhood.
Looking now on the beautiful, smiling face,
Lagardere extended his hand to the painted cloth,
as if he almost hoped that the painted hand could
emerge from it and clasp his again in fellowship, and
so looking he renewed the pledge of brotherhood and
silently promised the murdered man a crown of revenge.
</p>
<p>
He turned to the picture of Louis de Gonzague, and
he thought of his speech in the moat of Caylus with
the masked shadow, and of the sudden murder of
Nevers, and of his own assault upon the murderer,
and how he set his mark upon his wrist. The expression
on Lagardere&#8217;s face was cold and grave and
fatal as he studied this picture. If Gonzague could
have seen his face just then he would not have made
so merry beyond the folded doors.
</p>
<p>
Lagardere turned to the third Louis, the then
solemn, the then pale, Louis of France, and gave
him a military salute. "Monseigneur," he murmured,
"you are an honest man and a fine gentleman, and I
trust you cheerfully for my judge to-night." Turning,
he advanced to the doors that shut him off from the
noisy folk at supper, and listened for a moment, with
his head against the woodwork, to the revelry beyond,
an ironical smile on his face. Then, as one who recalls
himself abruptly to work that has to be done,
he who had been standing straight when he contemplated
the images now stooped again into the
crippled form of the hunchback and shook his hair
about his face. Raising his hand, he tapped thrice
on a panel of the doors, then moved slowly down to
the centre of the hall. A moment later the doors
parted a little, and Gonzague entered the room, closing
the doors behind him.
</p>
<p>
He advanced at once to where the hunchback
awaited him. "Your news?" he cried.
</p>
<p>
The hunchback made a gesture of reassurance.
"Sleep in peace. I have settled Lagardere&#8217;s business."
</p>
<p>
Gonzague gave a great sigh of satisfaction. "He
is dead?" he questioned.
</p>
<p>
The hunchback spoke, warmly. "As dead as my
hate could wish him."
</p>
<p>
"And his body?" Gonzague questioned.
</p>
<p>
The hunchback answered: "I have concealed his
body very effectively."
</p>
<p>
Gonzague brought his palms together silently in
silent applause. "Excellent Æsop! Where is Peyrolles?"
he asked.
</p>
<p>
The hunchback paused for a moment before replying.
"He sends his excuses. The events of the night
have upset him. But I think he will be with you soon."
</p>
<p>
The indisposition of Peyrolles did not seem to affect
his master very profoundly. What, indeed, did it
matter at such a moment to a man who knew that
his great enemy was harmless at last and that his
own plans and ambitions were safe? Gonzague came
nearer to the hunchback.
</p>
<p>
"Æsop, there is no doubt that Lagardere&#8217;s girl is
Nevers&#8217;s daughter. She has his features, his eyes,
his hair. Her mother would recognize her in a moment
if she saw her, but&mdash;"
</p>
<p>
He paused, and the hunchback repeated his last
word interrogatively: "But&mdash;?"
</p>
<p>
Gonzague smiled, not enigmatically. "She never
will see her. Nevers&#8217;s daughter is not destined to
live long."
</p>
<p>
Well at ease now, and more than ever in the mood
for joyous company, Gonzague turned to re-enter the
supper-room, but the hunchback clawed at him and
brought him to a halt. Gonzague stared at his follower
in a bewilderment which the hunchback proceeded
partially to enlighten. "You have forgotten
something."
</p>
<p>
"What?" asked Gonzague, in amazement.
</p>
<p>
The hunchback made a little, appealing gesture.
"Little Æsop wants his reward."
</p>
<p>
Gonzague thought he understood now. "True.
What is your price?"
</p>
<p>
The hunchback, more bowed than ever, with his
hair more than ever huddled about his face, swayed
his crippled body whimsically, and when he spoke
he spoke, apologetically: "I am a man of strange
fancies, highness."
</p>
<p>
Gonzague was annoyed at these preliminaries to a
demand, this beating about the bush for payment.
"Don&#8217;t plague me with your fancies. Your price?"
</p>
<p>
The hunchback spoke, slowly, like a man who
measures his words and enjoys the process of measurement:
"If I killed Lagardere, it was not solely
to please you. It was partly to please myself. I
was jealous."
</p>
<p>
Gonzague smiled slightly. "Of his swordsmanship?"
</p>
<p>
The hunchback protested, vehemently. "No, I was
his equal there. I was jealous of his luck in love."
</p>
<p>
Gonzague laughed. "Æsop in love!"
</p>
<p>
The hunchback seemed to take the laugh in good
part. "Æsop is in love, and you can give him his
heart&#8217;s desire. She was in Lagardere&#8217;s keeping. She
is now in yours. Give her to me."
</p>
<p>
Gonzague almost reeled under the amazing impudence
of the suggestion. "Gabrielle de Nevers!
Madman!"
</p>
<p>
He laughed as he spoke, but the hunchback interrupted
his laugh. "Wait. You have to walk over
two dead women to touch the wealth of Nevers. I
offer to take one woman out of your way. Do not
kill Gabrielle; give her to me."
</p>
<p>
Gonzague stared for a while at the hunchback in
silence. "I believe the rogue is serious," he said,
more as a reflection addressed to himself than as a
remark addressed to the hunchback.
</p>
<p>
But the hunchback answered it: "Yes, for I love
her. Give her to me, and I will take her far away
from Paris, and you shall never hear of her again.
She will no longer be the daughter of Nevers; she
will be the wife of Æsop the hunchback."
</p>
<p>
The proposition was not unpleasing to Louis of
Gonzague. It certainly seemed to offer a way of
getting rid of the girl without the necessity of killing
her, and Gonzague was too fastidious to desire to
commit murder where murder was wholly unnecessary,
but the thing seemed impossible. "She would
never consent," he protested.
</p>
<p>
The hunchback laughed softly, a low laugh of self-confidence.
"Look at me, monseigneur," he said,
"Æsop the hunchback, but do not laugh while you
look and damn me for an impossible gallant. Crooked
and withered as I am, I have power to make
women love me. Let me try. If I fail to win the
girl, do what you please with her, and I will ask no
more."
</p>
<p>
Gonzague looked keenly at the bowed, supplicating
figure. "Are you thinking of playing me false?" he
murmured. "Do you dream of taking the girl to
give her to her mother?"
</p>
<p>
The hunchback laughed&mdash;a dry, strident laugh.
"Would Æsop be a welcome son-in-law to the Princess
de Gonzague?"
</p>
<p>
Gonzague seemed to feel the force of the hunchback&#8217;s
reasoning. To marry the girl to this malformed
assassin was to destroy her more utterly, she still
living, than to destroy her by taking her life. "Well,"
he said&mdash;"well, you shall try your luck. If she marries
you, she is out of my way. If she refuses you, you
shall be avenged for her disdain. We can always
revert to my first intention."
</p>
<p>
A slight shudder seemed to pass over the distorted
form of the hunchback, but he responded with familiar
confidence: "She will not disdain me."
</p>
<p>
Gonzague laughed. "Confident wooer. When do
you mean to woo?"
</p>
<p>
The hunchback came a little nearer to him and
spoke, eagerly: "No time like the present, highness.
I thought that on this night of triumph for you I
could provide for you and your friends such an entertainment
as no other man in all Paris could command.
I have ventured to summon your notary.
Let your supper be my wedding-feast, your guests
my witnesses. Bring the girl and I will win her. I
am sure of it&mdash;sure."
</p>
<p>
Gonzague was too well-bred, too scholarly a man
not to have a well-bred, scholarly sense of humor.
His nimble Italian fancy saw at once the contrasts
between his noisy company of light men and loose
women and the withered hunchback who was a murderer
and the beautiful girl whom he had robbed
of her birthright and was now ready to rob of her
honor. "It will be a good jest," he murmured.
</p>
<p>
The hunchback indorsed his words: "The best
jest in the world. You will laugh and laugh and
laugh to watch the hunchback&#8217;s courtship."
</p>
<p>
Gonzague turned again towards the doors. "I
must rejoin my guests," he said; "but you look something
glum and dull for a suitor. You should have
fine clothes, fellow; they will stimulate your tongue
when you come to the wooing. Go to my steward for
a wedding-garment. Your bride will be here when
you return."
</p>
<p>
The hunchback&#8217;s bowed head came nearer still to
earth in his profound inclination. "You overwhelm
me with kindness."
</p>
<p>
Gonzague paused, with his hand on the door, to
look at him again. "You kill Lagardere; you marry
Gabrielle. Do I owe you most as bravo or bridegroom?"
</p>
<p>
Again the hunchback abased himself. "Your highness
shall decide by-and-by." Then he turned and
went out through the antechamber and left Gonzague
alone.
</p>
<p>
Gonzague rubbed his hands. "Æsop is my good
genius." Then he touched a bell and a servant entered,
to whom he gave instructions. "Tell Madame
Berthe to come with the girl who was placed in her
charge to-night."
</p>
<p>
The servant bowed and disappeared. Gonzague
went to the golden doors and threw them open.
Standing in the aperture, he summoned his friends to
join him. Instantly there was a great noise of rising
revellers, of chairs set back, of glasses set down, of fans
caught up, of fluttered skirts and lifted rapiers. Men
and women, the guests of Gonzague, flooded from the
supper-room into the great hall, and under the gaze
of the Three Louis, Oriol with his fancy, Navailles
with Cidalise, Taranne, Nocé, and the others, each
with his raddled Egeria of the opera-house and the
ballet. As they fluttered and flirted and laughed and
chattered into the great hall, Gonzague held up his
hand for a moment, as one that calls for silence, and
in a moment the revellers were silent.
</p>
<p>
Gonzague spoke: "Friends, I have good news.
Lagardere is dead."
</p>
<p>
A wild burst of applause greeted these words. The
pretty women clapped their hands as they would
have clapped them in the theatre for some dance or
song that took their fancy. The men were not less
enthusiastic. The difference between the men and
the women was that the men applauded because they
knew why their master was pleased; the women applauded
because their master was pleased without asking
the reason why. The name of Lagardere meant
little or nothing to them.
</p>
<p>
Nocé spoke a short funeral oration: "The scamp
has cheated the gallows."
</p>
<p>
When the applause had died down, Gonzague spoke
again: "Also I have good sport for you. To-night
you shall witness a wedding."
</p>

<h2>XXVII</h2>
<h3>ÆSOP IN LOVE</h3>
</div>

<p>
Again the applause broke forth. Oriol, his round
eyes growing rounder, echoed the last words as a
question: "A wedding?"
</p>
<p>
Gonzague nodded. "A wonderful wedding. The
bride is a beauty, and the bridegroom is Æsop."
</p>
<p>
Navailles looked round over his companions and
sighed for the absence of a choice spirit. "How
Chavernay would have laughed!" he said. "I wish
he were here."
</p>
<p>
"I did not invite Chavernay," Gonzague replied,
coldly.
</p>
<p>
And even as he spoke the door of the antechamber
opened and Chavernay made his appearance unannounced,
as briskly impudent, as cheerfully self-confident
as ever. He shook a finger in playful reproof
at Gonzague as he advanced, wholly unimpressed by
the slight frown which knitted the brows of his unexpected
host. "It was most unkind of you; but another
makes good your neglect, whose invitation I
really had not the strength of purpose to refuse."
</p>
<p>
Gonzague&#8217;s irritation was not altogether dissipated
by the coolness of his kinsman, but he judged that
any show of anger was unbefitting so felicitous an
occasion, so he smiled slightly as he asked: "Who invites
you?"
</p>
<p>
Chavernay looked all around him, scanning the
faces of the men in the brilliant group of Gonzague&#8217;s
guests, as if seeking there a countenance he failed
to find. Then he answered, in a tone of voice that
was unusually grave for the light-hearted marquis:
"Henri de Lagardere."
</p>
<p>
At the sound of that name a thrill ran through the
guests, and all echoed with astonishment the name
of Lagardere.
</p>
<p>
Gonzague looked at Chavernay with a pitying
smile. "You come too late," he said, "if you come
at the summons of such a host. Lagardere is dead."
</p>
<p>
Chavernay gave a little start of surprise, while the
others, to whom the news had been good news some
little while ago, but was no news at all now, laughed
boisterously at his expected discomfiture. But Chavernay
did not seem to be discomfited, and seemed
inclined to doubt the tidings. "Dead?" he said.
"Why, he wrote to me to meet him here at two
o&#8217;clock."
</p>
<p>
As he spoke he drew from his breast a folded piece
of paper and extended it to Gonzague, who took it
with a reluctance, even with a repugnance, which he
controlled because it was so clearly unreasonable.
The paper contained a few words written in a bold,
soldierly hand. They ran thus:
</p>
<table summary='poetry'>
<col style='width:5em;' />
<tr><td></td><td><p style='margin-top:0.0em; margin-bottom:-0.25em'>
"Meet me to-night at two o&#8217;clock at the palace of the
</p></td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td><p style='margin-top:0.0em; margin-bottom:-0.25em'>
Prince de Gonzague.               <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Henri de Lagardere.</span>"
</p></td></tr>
</table>
<p>
Gonzague returned the paper to Chavernay with
an ironical smile. "Somebody has been hoaxing
you," he said. "You will not meet Lagardere here."
</p>
<p>
Taranne consulted his watch. "It is now two
o&#8217;clock," he said, and showed the dial to Chavernay,
who looked puzzled, but also unconvinced.
</p>
<p>
"No one will come," said Navailles, mockingly.
</p>
<p>
At that moment Chavernay&#8217;s quick ear caught the
sound of footsteps in the private passage outside,
and called attention to the sound. "Some one is
coming. Is it Lagardere?"
</p>
<p>
As he spoke all eyes were fixed upon the door. So
firmly had the fear of Lagardere emanated from the
consciousness of Gonzague to impress the hearts of
his party that even then, when all present had the
assurance from their leader that Lagardere was dead
and done with, their conviction not unsettled, indeed,
but somewhat disturbed by Chavernay&#8217;s words and
Chavernay&#8217;s strange message, waited with uneasy
expectation for what might happen. Then the door
opened fully, and the hunchback came into the
room, dressed now with a splendor of attire which
seemed to contrast more grotesquely than his wonted
sable with his twisted, withered figure. All present,
including Gonzague, had for the moment forgotten
the existence of the hunchback. All present,
with the exception of Chavernay, burst into the
loud laughter of relieved nerves as they beheld
him.
</p>
<p>
"This is not Lagardere," said Oriol, holding his
fat sides.
</p>
<p>
The hunchback laughed a mocking laugh in answer
to the amusement of the company and the amazement
of Chavernay. "Who speaks of Lagardere?
Who remembers Lagardere? Æsop is the hero of
this feast; Æsop is a gentleman to-night, with a silk
coat on his back and a lace kerchief in his fingers.
He woos a beauty, and the chivalry of France shall
witness his triumph. Lagardere is dead! Long live
Æsop, who killed him!"
</p>
<p>
The little marquis advanced towards the jesting
hunchback with clinched hands and angry eyes.
"Assassin!" he cried, and seemed as if he would take
the hunchback by the throat, but Gonzague came between
his kinsman and his servant, saying, coldly:
"Whoever insults Æsop, insults me. Æsop marries
the girl whom Lagardere called Gabrielle de Nevers."
</p>
<p>
Chavernay folded his arms and looked fiercely
around him. "Now I know why Lagardere sent for
me&mdash;to defend a helpless woman."
</p>
<p>
The hunchback drolled at him: "She will not need
your championship. She will accept with joy the
hunchback&#8217;s hand."
</p>
<p>
Chavernay shook his head scornfully. "That will
never happen."
</p>
<p>
The hunchback answered him, coolly: "That will
happen, Monsieur de Chavernay."
</p>
<p>
At that moment the door opposite to the antechamber
opened, and the figure of a fair girl appeared.
</p>
<p>
"Your bride approaches," said Gonzague, and
moved towards the new-comer, suddenly pausing
with an angry frown as he perceived that she was not
alone, for Gabrielle, very pale, but with courage in
her eyes and determination on her lips, entered the
room accompanied by the gypsy girl Flora. To Flora
Gonzague spoke, angrily: "Why are you here? This
is no place for you."
</p>
<p>
The gypsy looked at him defiantly. "This is my
place," she said, "for I have found my friend, and I
think she needs my friendship."
</p>
<p>
Gonzague spoke, imperiously: "Retire, Mademoiselle
de Nevers!"
</p>
<p>
The gypsy girl gave him no answer, but held her
ground mutinously. Gabrielle moved a little away
from her friend&#8217;s side. She asserted her right firmly.
"I am Gabrielle de Nevers."
</p>
<p>
Again Gonzague addressed Flora: "Mademoiselle
de Nevers," he said, "have you not undeceived this
unfortunate, this misguided girl?"
</p>
<p>
Flora answered him, steadily: "No, highness, for I
believe her."
</p>
<p>
Gonzague began to lose his patience. He was
bound, in the presence of his friends, to keep up the
assumption of belief in the gentility of Flora, in her
heirship to Nevers. He addressed her, harshly:
"Mademoiselle de Nevers, if you are mad enough
to wish to abandon your rights to an impostor, I am
here to protect you, and I order you at once to retire."
</p>
<p>
Flora gave no sign of obedience, and Gabrielle
spoke again: "I am Gabrielle de Nevers. Why have
I been brought here?"
</p>
<p>
Gonzague turned to her, and his manner was that
of a judge coolly courteous to one whom he professed
to believe possibly innocent of complicity in sin:
"You have been brought here because I did not wish
to deliver you to the stern justice of the law. Your
offence is grave, but the fault lies with your accomplice,
and his alone the penalty."
</p>
<p>
Gabrielle looked all about her, sustaining bravely
the bold stares of the dancing-women and the evil
admiration of the men. "Where is Henri de Lagardere?"
she asked; and then, as only silence followed
upon her question, she cried: "Ah, he must be dead,
since he is not here to defend me."
</p>
<p>
Gonzague confirmed her fears: "He is dead."
</p>
<p>
Chavernay, who had kept resolutely apart from the
rest of the guests, now advanced to the beautiful
girl who stood there alone and friendless, save for
Flora, and made her a respectful bow. "I will defend
you in his name," he said, simply.
</p>
<p>
Flora clapped her hands. "Bravo, little man!"
she cried.
</p>
<p>
Gonzague, with a stern gesture, motioned to Chavernay
to stand back. "You presume," he said. "I
offer this deluded girl protection. It is for me to
see that she is properly provided for."
</p>
<p>
Gabrielle gave him a glance that pierced through
his specious protestations. "You wish the daughter
of Nevers to die. If you have killed Lagardere, I
have no wish to live."
</p>
<p>
Gonzague answered her, urbanely: "You take the
matter too seriously. You have shared an imposture.
I propose to shield you from punishment. You shall
tramp the highways no longer. Here is an honest
gentleman ready to marry you, to forgive and to forget.
Advance, Æsop."
</p>
<p>
At that command the hunchback, who had been
leaning against a chair an apparently amused spectator
of the not untragic scene, shambled slowly forward
more ungainly than ever in his finery, his long
sword swinging grotesquely against his legs.
</p>
<p>
Flora gave a cry of indignation. "Are you mad?
That monster!"
</p>
<p>
The hunchback&#8217;s answer to her words was a comic
bow, which made Gonzague&#8217;s friends laugh. Gabrielle
looked at the laughing gentlemen, and there was something
so brave, so stately in her gaze that the laughter
died away.
</p>
<p>
"Gentlemen," she said, "you bear honorable names,
you wear honorable swords. Gentlemen, the daughter
of Nevers appeals to you to protect her from insult."
</p>
<p>
Even Gonzague&#8217;s band, hardened by the influence
of long association with their master, could not hear
that appeal unmoved, though no man among them
made any motion of responding to it.
</p>
<p>
Chavernay, however, rested his hand lightly upon
his sword-hilt. "Rely on me," he said, boldly.
</p>
<p>
Gonzague looked at him contemptuously. "No
heroics, sir. The lady is free to choose between the
husband I offer and the law that chastises impostors."
He turned to the hunchback, who stood near
him. "I fear your love affair goes ill, Æsop."
</p>
<p>
The hunchback did not seem at all disheartened.
"It will go better when I take it in hand myself. Let
me speak to the lady alone."
</p>
<p>
Flora fiercely protested: "No, no, no!"
</p>
<p>
But Gonzague turned to her with a look so menacing
that even her courage quailed before it. "For
your friend&#8217;s sake, be quiet, Mademoiselle de Nevers,"
he said. Taking Flora by the hand, he drew her,
partly by main force and partly by strength of his
dominating influence, away from Gabrielle. Then he
turned to his friends. "Ladies and gentlemen," he
said, "our good Æsop desires to speak to the lady
of his love in private. We are all, I am sure, too
sympathetic with his amorous ambition to interfere
with his wishes. Let him ply his wooing untroubled.
Stand apart, please, and give Æsop a fair
field."
</p>
<p>
Wondering, laughing, whispering, Gonzague&#8217;s guests
drew back and ranged themselves against the golden
doors, and Gabrielle was left standing alone in the
middle of the room. The hunchback caught up a
chair and carried it to where she stood, making a
gesture which requested her to be seated.
</p>
<p>
Gabrielle looked at him scornfully. "I have nothing
to say to you. I trust to the justice of France."
</p>
<p>
The hunchback spoke to her in a low voice, so evenly
calculated that every syllable of what he said was
clear to the girl&#8217;s ears, though no syllable reached the
others: "Do not start; do not show surprise."
</p>
<p>
Gabrielle had the strength of spirit to control the
wonder, the joy, the hope at the sound of the loved
voice thus brought her so suddenly; but she trembled,
and her strength seemed to fail her. She sank into
the chair which the hunchback had offered her. "My
God!" she murmured, and then said no more, but
sat with clasped hands and rigid face.
</p>
<p>
The hunchback spoke again, in the same low, measured
tones: "Seem to listen against your will. A
sign may betray us both."
</p>
<p>
"Henri!" Gabrielle murmured.
</p>
<p>
The hunchback went on: "Seem as if you were enchanted
at my words, by my gestures. They are
watching us."
</p>
<p>
Now the hunchback walked slowly in a circle round
the chair on which Gabrielle was seated, making as
he did so fantastic gestures with his hands over her
head&mdash;gestures which suggested to the amazed spectators
some wizard busy with his horrid incantations.
</p>
<p>
Taranne nudged Oriol. "She listens."
</p>
<p>
"She seems pleased," Oriol answered.
</p>
<p>
Chavernay muttered, angrily: "This must be witch-craft."
</p>
<p>
Nocé, leaning forward a little, called to the hunchback:
"How speeds your suit?"
</p>
<p>
The hunchback paused for a moment in his round
to make a motion for silence. "Famously, gentlemen,
famously. But you must not disturb my incantations."
</p>
<p>
Navailles touched Nocé on the shoulder. "Let the
dog have his day."
</p>
<p>
The hunchback was again at the side of Gabrielle,
still indulging in extravagant antics of gesticulation,
speaking softly the while. "Gabrielle, they think me
dead, but I live and hope to save you. But we
face danger, dear, but we face death, and must be
wary. Will you do whatever I tell you to do?"
</p>
<p>
"Yes," Gabrielle answered.
</p>
<p>
The hunchback went on: "God knows how this
night will end. I have told them that I can make
you love me."
</p>
<p>
Almost Gabrielle smiled. "You have told them
the truth."
</p>
<p>
The hunchback continued: "I have told them that
I can persuade you to marry me."
</p>
<p>
Gabrielle said again: "You have told them the
truth."
</p>
<p>
The hunchback sighed. He was still cutting his
strange capers, waving his extended fingers over the
girl&#8217;s head and making grotesque genuflections, but
he spoke, and his voice was full of passion and his
voice was full of pain as he whispered: "Gabrielle,
Gabrielle, I have always loved you, shall always love
you. But you must not love me, that would never
do. Nevers&#8217;s daughter cannot, may not, love the soldier
of fortune."
</p>
<p>
"Yet you ask me to marry you?" Gabrielle said.
</p>
<p>
The hunchback answered: "To save you from Gonzague.
You would have died to-night but for this
mad plan of mine. Once you are safe, you can easily
be set free from me."
</p>
<p>
There was that in Gabrielle&#8217;s eyes which the hunchback
could not see. There was that in Gabrielle&#8217;s
heart which the hunchback could not read. Gabrielle
appreciated the nobility of the man who was
trying to save her, but Gabrielle also understood the
strength of her own love and her own determination,
but she showed nothing of this in her words. All she
said was: "Well, I am not safe yet. What do you
want me to do?"
</p>
<p>
The hunchback instructed her. "Just say yes to
the questions I shall ask you now aloud. Speak as
if you were in a dream."
</p>
<p>
He drew back now a little from the girl, and turned
triumphantly to the others, with the air of one who
has accomplished a very difficult task. Then he approached
Gabrielle again.
</p>
<p>
"Do you love me?" he asked, in a clear voice which
carried to all parts of the room.
</p>
<p>
And the girl, looking straight before her like one
that spoke in a trance, answered, clearly: "I love you
with all my heart, for ever and ever and ever."
</p>
<p>
Gonzague, who had been watching the proceedings
with cynical curiosity, was the most amazed of the
amazed spectators. "Here is a miracle."
</p>
<p>
"I&#8217;ll not believe it," Chavernay protested.
</p>
<p>
The hunchback made an angry gesture to command
silence. "Hush!" he said, and then again addressed
the girl: "Will you be my wife?"
</p>
<p>
Gabrielle answered as clearly as before: "I will be
your wife gladly. In joy and in sorrow, I will be
your wife so long as I live."
</p>
<p>
The hunchback turned triumphantly to the company.
"Gentlemen, gentlemen, you see that my
suit prospers. The poor hunchback was no boaster."
</p>
<p>
Flora, seated near to Gonzague, and conquered by
his domination and by the horror of the scene, covered
her face with her hands and shuddered. "It&#8217;s
too horrible," she moaned.
</p>
<p>
The hunchback nodded to her ironically. "You
are severe," he said, dryly. Then he turned to Gonzague.
"There is a friend of mine at the door," he
said. "May I introduce him?"
</p>
<p>
Gonzague nodded, and the hunchback advanced to
the door of the antechamber.
</p>
<p>
Chavernay looked after him with haggard eyes.
"What spell has the devil got?" he muttered.
</p>
<p>
Gonzague shrugged his shoulders. "I am amazed;
but the knave has my faith, and, if the lady&#8217;s taste
limps, shall we say her nay?"

<h2>XXVIII</h2>
<h3>THE SIGNATURE OF ÆSOP</h3>
</div>

<p>
By this time the hunchback had opened the door
and introduced to the company a dapper, affable
gentleman who was habited, as became his calling,
for the most part in black; but he lent an air of smartness
to his notarial garb by reason that the black of
his coat and breeches was of silk, and that he wore a
quantity of costly lace. This was Master Griveau,
one of the principal notaries of Paris, and a man that
had been employed not a little by the Prince de
Gonzague. For this reason his face was familiar to
most of those present, and the faces of most of those
present were familiar to Master Griveau, and Master
Griveau nodded and bowed and smirked and smiled,
and showed in a hundred little ways with a hundred
little airs and graces that he was quite the man of the
world and quite at home in fashionable circles. He
was accompanied by two of his clerks, who seemed
as anxious to efface themselves as their master was
to assert his personality.
</p>
<p>
The hunchback patted the notary on the back with
a pat that made him give at the knees and look somewhat
ruefully about him as if an earthquake had
occurred, and introduced him to the company: "Here,
sirs, is my Cupid&mdash;nay, better than Cupid, for Cupid
had no pockets, whereas Maître Griveau has, and
my marriage contract in one of them."
</p>
<p>
Master Griveau, with the air of one who could take
a joke as well as any man if the joke were proffered
in august company, produced a large, folded paper
bound about with green ribbon. He bowed profoundly
to Gonzague. "In accordance," he said, "with
monseigneur&#8217;s instructions, as conveyed to me by
monseigneur&#8217;s"&mdash;he halted for a moment, and then
continued&mdash;"Monseigneur&#8217;s friend, the deed is prepared
and ready for signature. Have I monseigneur&#8217;s
permission to make a few preparations for the interesting
ceremony?"
</p>
<p>
Gonzague nodded, and the brisk little man, with
the aid of his two clerks, pushed a table into place,
arranged writing materials, and, seating himself with
a great air of formality, investigated a quill pen,
spread out his contract, and surveyed the company
with the air of one who should say: "I have done,
and done well, all that it becometh me to do; it is now
for you to play your part in this ceremony."
</p>
<p>
Gonzague addressed the notary: "Have you entered
the names of groom and bride?"
</p>
<p>
Master Griveau gave a little, protesting cough. "I
do not know them, your highness. I have left blank
spaces for the names."
</p>
<p>
Gonzague pointed to Gabrielle, where she sat
apart. "The lady is Mademoiselle de Lagardere."
Then he turned to the hunchback. "And you, what
is your lawful name, Æsop?"
</p>
<p>
The hunchback made an appeal to Gonzague.
"Highness, humor my jest to the end. I have kept
my real name a secret long enough; let me keep it
secret a little longer. Will you and your friends
honor me by signing as witnesses? Then I will fill
in the blanks and set down my own name&mdash;a name
that will make you laugh."
</p>
<p>
Oriol gave a grin. "Æsop is comic enough."
</p>
<p>
Lagardere nodded to him. "Æsop is a nickname.
My true name will divert you more. Sign, sirs, sign."
</p>
<p>
Master Griveau, with due solemnity, unfolded the
contract and spread it before him. Then he dipped
a pen in the ink, and stood waiting for the illustrious
company to sign the contract.
</p>
<p>
"Give me the pen," said Gonzague. He was beginning
to tire a little of the comedy, in spite of its
element of marvel, and to wish the girl well out of his
sight with her hunchback husband. He signed his
name and held up the pen. It was eagerly sought
for. Taranne gained the privilege of taking it from
the fingers of his master. Taranne signed, Nocé
signed, Oriol signed, Gironne signed, Choisy signed,
Albret signed, Montaubert signed. When the pen
was offered to Chavernay, Chavernay put his hands
behind his back and shook his head. It came to
Navailles to sign last.
</p>
<p>
"Now for the happy pair," Navailles said. As he
spoke he turned to where the hunchback and Gabrielle
stood together silent, a strangely contrasted
bride and bridegroom&mdash;youth and age, so it seemed,
beauty and ugliness, sin and purity. Truly, it appeared
to be what Chavernay thought it and called
it&mdash;a damnable alliance.
</p>
<p>
While the signing had been toward the hunchback
had spoken softly one sentence to his bride. "Gabrielle,"
he said, "if I die here, I die as I have lived&mdash;your
lover."
</p>
<p>
And Gabrielle had answered him in the heart of
her heart: "I love you, my lover."
</p>
<p>
Now, when Navailles addressed him, the hunchback
moved forward, and waved away the little,
glittering crowd of gentlemen that gathered about
Master Griveau at the table, ordering them to move.
"Make space, sirs, for my wife and me. I need
elbow-room for my signature."
</p>
<p>
He advanced to the table, holding Gabrielle by
the hand, and still, though the humor of the situation
had endured so long, even the wine-flushed men and
the wine-flushed women seemed almost as conscious
as Chavernay of the tragedy that underlay the humor
of the play. All fell back and left a free table
for the hunchback and his bride. Master Griveau
settled himself comfortably in his seat and took up
his pen. Turning to the hunchback, he began: "Give
me your names, your surnames, your birthplaces&mdash;"
</p>
<p>
The hunchback interrupted him: "Have you
signed?"
</p>
<p>
"Certainly," Master Griveau answered, something
astonished at being thus carelessly treated.
</p>
<p>
"Then, by your leave," said the hunchback, and
dexterously edged the indignant notary out of the
chair. "Leave the rest to me. Back, friends, till
I finish." Pushing the chair aside, he restrained with
a sweep of his arm the advancing crowd of gentlemen
eager to see the name that Æsop would acknowledge.
</p>
<p>
While Master Griveau, with a very much offended
air, edged himself into the circle of Gonzague&#8217;s friends
as one that had earned the right to move freely in
such company, the hunchback began rapidly to fill
in the blank spaces on the parchment before him.
</p>
<p>
Master Griveau felt it his duty to say a few words
of protest on behalf of the slightly offended majesty of
the law. "A very extraordinary ceremony, highness."
</p>
<p>
Gonzague smiled ironically, but cared nothing for
the offended majesty of the law, so long as his own
purposes were being served. "Æsop is an extraordinary
man," he said.
</p>
<p>
The hunchback, who had overheard this conversation,
pointed with the feather of the pen he had just
been using to Gonzague. "You are right, prince,"
he said. Then he gave the pen to Gabrielle and
whispered to her, so low that no one heard him: "Sign
Gabrielle de Nevers."
</p>
<p>
The girl took the pen from his hand and signed boldly,
though she signed that signature for the first time
in her young life.
</p>
<p>
The hunchback took the pen from her fingers.
"Now my turn." Deliberately and swiftly he signed
his name and flung down the pen. Then he moved
back a little way from the table and drew Gabrielle
behind him. He turned to the expectant company.
"Come and see, sirs. You will stare, I promise you."
</p>
<p>
All were eager to press forward and read the signature,
but all restrained their desire until the curiosity
of the master of the house was satisfied. Gonzague
advanced leisurely to the table, relieved to think the
comedy had come to an end, and that he had satisfactorily
rid himself of an incubus. He bent carelessly
over the parchment, and then sprang back with
face as pale and eyes as wild and lips as trembling
as if on the pitiful piece of sheepskin he had seen some
terror as dread as the face of Medusa. His twitching
mouth whispered one word, but that word was
"Lagardere!" and that word was repeated on the lips
of every man and woman that watched him.
</p>
<p>
Before the eyes of all present a new miracle happened,
more marvellous than its predecessor, for the
hunchback suddenly stiffened himself and became
erect and soldierly; the hunchback swept back the
grizzled locks that had so long served to conceal his
features; the hunchback stood before them a strong
and stalwart man, with drawn sword in his hand.
Stretching out his arm, he extended the sword between
Gonzague and the parchment and touched with
its point the signature that was still wet upon its surface.
</p>
<p>
In a terrible voice he cried: "Lagardere, who always
keeps his tryst! I am here!"
</p>
<p>
For a moment that seemed sempiternal a kind of
horrible silence reigned over the room. It was hard
to understand what had happened. The startled
guests stared at one another, terrified by the terror
on Gonzague&#8217;s face, amazed at the metamorphosis of
the hunchback, shuddering at the name of Lagardere.
The first to recover courage, composure, and
resolution was Gonzague himself. He sprang from
the table to where his friends stood together and drew
his sword.
</p>
<p>
Pointing to where Lagardere stood, with Gabrielle
clinging to his arm, he cried: "He must not escape!
Your swords, friends! It is but one man!"
</p>
<p>
But even as he spoke, and while Lagardere was
waiting with lifted sword for the inevitable attack,
Chavernay crossed the room and stood at Lagardere&#8217;s
side. "We shall be two!" he cried, and drew his
sword.
</p>
<p>
At the same moment the doors of the antechamber
opened, and Cocardasse and Passepoil, with their
naked swords in their hands, entered and ranged
themselves on the side of Lagardere.
</p>
<p>
"We shall be three!" said Cocardasse.
</p>
<p>
"We shall be four!" said Passepoil.
</p>
<p>
The situation was changed, but the situation was
still perilous. On the one side of the splendid room
stood Lagardere, with Chavernay, Cocardasse, and
Passepoil, their gleaming weapons ready for attack.
On the other side, with a great gap of space between
the two parties, stood Gonzague and his cluster of
light friends, every man of whom had bared his rapier
and was ready to obey the summons of his chief.
Behind these the women huddled together, some
screaming, but the most part too frightened to scream.
Flora, overstrained, had fainted.
</p>
<p>
Lagardere taunted Gonzague. "Come, monseigneur,"
he said, "are you afraid? The odds are not so
favorable as they were at Caylus."
</p>
<p>
With a writhing face Gonzague screamed to his
friends: "Charge!"
</p>
<p>
And Lagardere answered with a ringing cry: "I
am here!"
</p>
<p>
In another moment the two parties would have met
and blended in battle; but before Gonzague&#8217;s followers
could obey his command and follow his lead, they
were stiffened into immobility by a sudden knocking
at the golden doors. At that unexpected sound every
sword was lowered, and then from beyond a stern
voice came, commanding: "Open, in the king&#8217;s name!"
</p>

<h3>THE DEAD SPEAKS</h3>
</div>

<p>
Immediately the golden doors were flung open,
and Bonnivet entered from the supper-room, followed
by a company of soldiers.
</p>
<p>
Gonzague turned to Bonnivet, indignant and bewildered.
"What does this mean?" he gasped.
</p>
<p>
Bonnivet&#8217;s answer was to salute with his sword,
as he announced: "His majesty the king!" And
through the double line of soldiers Louis of France
entered the room with the Princess de Gonzague on
his arm.
</p>
<p>
The king looked with astonishment at the strange
scene before him&mdash;the fainting women, the two camps
of armed men, the scattered furniture. The Princess
de Gonzague looked only at the girl, who now hung
so lovingly upon the arm of Lagardere.
</p>
<p>
"Why have I been sent for?" the king asked.
</p>
<p>
And instantly Lagardere answered him: "To witness
my restoration of Mademoiselle Gabrielle de
Nevers to her mother." As he spoke he moved towards
the princess, and gave Gabrielle to her out-stretched
arms.
</p>
<p>
The Princess gave a cry of joy. "She has the face
of Louis! She is my child!"
</p>
<p>
Gonzague tried to speak, and failed; tried to speak
again, and succeeded: "Your highness, I again declare
that I gave the true Gabrielle de Nevers to her
mother. I have the page torn from the register of
the chapel of Caylus in this sealed packet." As he
spoke he held out a small sealed packet, which he
had drawn from his breast.
</p>
<p>
The king turned to Lagardere. "What do you
say to this?"
</p>
<p>
Lagardere answered: "That I have kept my word.
I have given back her daughter to the princess. I
will now unmask the murderer."
</p>
<p>
Again the king questioned him: "Where are your
witnesses?"
</p>
<p>
Lagardere turned and pointed with his drawn
sword to Gonzague: "You are the first."
</p>
<p>
Gonzague, trying hard to recover his composure,
raged at him: "Madman!"
</p>
<p>
Lagardere turned to the king and spoke more solemnly:
"The second is in the grave."
</p>
<p>
Gonzague laughed. "The dead cannot speak."
</p>
<p>
Lagardere still looked menacingly at Gonzague.
"To-night the dead will speak. The proofs of your
guilt are in that sealed packet, stolen from me by
assassins in your pay."
</p>
<p>
Gonzague turned to the king, protesting: "Sire!"
</p>
<p>
Lagardere interrupted him: "Monseigneur, he is
going to say that that packet contains only the birth-lines
of Mademoiselle de Nevers&mdash;but there is more
than that."
</p>
<p>
Louis of Orleans turned his steady gaze on Louis
of Gonzague, and read little to comfort him in the
twitching face of his life-long friend. "Break the
seals, Louis," he commanded.
</p>
<p>
Lagardere spoke, exultingly: "Yes, break the seals
and read your doom, assassin. The packet contains
only the birth-lines of Mademoiselle de Nevers, but
still it contains the proof I ask. As Nevers lay dying
in my arms, he dipped his finger in his blood and
traced on the parchment the name of his murderer.
Open the packet and see what name is there."
</p>
<p>
Now, while he was speaking, Gonzague began to
tremble like a man that has the trembling sickness;
but as Lagardere continued he seemed by a desperate
effort to stiffen himself, and, moving slowly, unobserved
by those present, who were for the most part
busy with looking upon Lagardere, he neared a
candelabrum. As Lagardere uttered his last command,
Gonzague thrust the packet that he held into
the flame of the candle, and in a moment the flame
ran along the paper, lapping it and consuming it.
The king and Lagardere both saw the despairing
deed.
</p>
<p>
The king was the first to speak. "Louis!" he
cried, and could say no more.
</p>
<p>
Gonzague dropped the burning paper from his
fingers, and it fell in ashes upon the floor.
</p>
<p>
Lagardere lifted his sword in triumph. "The dead
speaks! There was nothing written on that paper.
His name was not there, but his own deed has set it
there."
</p>
<p>
The eyes of all were fixed upon the face of Gonzague,
and the face of Gonzague was an ugly sight
to see. Hatred and despair struggled there for mastery&mdash;hatred
and despair, and the hideous sense of
hopeless, ignominious, public failure after a lifetime
of triumphant crime.
</p>
<p>
"Louis!" cried the king again. "Louis! Assassin!"
</p>
<p>
In a moment Gonzague&#8217;s sword was unsheathed,
and he leaped across the space that divided him from
Lagardere, striking furiously for Lagardere&#8217;s heart.
But Lagardere was ready for him, and, with a familiar
trick of the fencing-schools, wrenched Gonzague&#8217;s
weapon from his fingers and flung it to the floor. A
dozen hands seized Gonzague&mdash;the hands of those
that once had been proud to call themselves his
friends.
</p>
<p>
Lagardere turned to the king, appealingly: "Monseigneur,
I cry a favor. Let me support this quarrel
with my sword, and God defend the right."
</p>
<p>
The king was silent for a few seconds, trying to set
himself right with a world that had suddenly changed
for him. Surely, it would be better to let it end so,
whatever came of it. He turned to Lagardere, and
bowed his head in silent approval: "As you will."
</p>
<p>
Suddenly, then, the Princess de Gonzague, clinging
to the child in her arms, cried out, calling to Chavernay:
"Monsieur de Chavernay, in yonder alcove lies
the sword of my dead husband. Fetch it, and give
it to Monsieur de Lagardere."
</p>
<p>
In a frightful silence Chavernay crossed the room,
entered the alcove, and came forth holding the sword
of Louis de Nevers in his hand&mdash;the sword that Louis
de Nevers had used so valiantly on the night of
Caylus. Silently he offered it to Lagardere, and
silently Lagardere, giving the weapon he held to
Cocardasse, took the sword of Nevers from the hands
of Chavernay. Thereafter Lagardere stooped and
picked up the fallen sword of Gonzague. Then, advancing
towards his enemy, he made a sign to those
that held him to release their captive&mdash;a sign that was
immediately obeyed. He held out the weapon by
its blade to Gonzague, who caught it. In another
moment the two men were engaged in combat.
</p>
<p>
On the walls the impassive portraits of the Three
Louis looked on while one of the Three Louis fought
for his shameful life, while another of the Three Louis
sat in heart-broken judgment upon him, and while
the widow of another of the Three Louis sat clasping
in her arms the child she had surrendered in the moat
of Caylus so many years ago.
</p>
<p>
Gonzague was a fine swordsman, and Gonzague
fought for his life, but he did not fight long. Suddenly
Lagardere&#8217;s arm and Lagardere&#8217;s sword seemed
to extend, the blade gleamed in the flare of the flambeaux,
and Gonzague reeled and dropped.
</p>
<p>
"Nine," said Cocardasse, thoughtfully.
</p>
<p>
Passepoil placed his forefinger between his brows.
"The thrust of Nevers," he murmured.
</p>
<p>
Lagardere lifted his blood-dyed sword and saluted
the picture of Louis of Nevers. "After the lackeys
the master. Nevers, I have kept my word."
</p>
<p>
Then he let fall his weapon, for the soft arms of
Gabrielle were about his neck.
